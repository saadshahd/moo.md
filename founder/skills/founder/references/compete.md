# Analyze Competition

Evaluate competitive landscape, blitzscaling potential, and defensive positioning.

## Input Required

Ask for (if not provided):

- Startup name or one-liner description
- Unique value or niche that differs from major players
- Current stage (idea/MVP/growth)

## Phase 1: Blitzscaling Analysis

Score on four factors (1-10 each):

| Factor                     | Score | Evidence (≤20 words)                           |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Market Size**            |       | TAM potential, growth trajectory               |
| **Distribution Advantage** |       | Viral loops, channel ownership, CAC efficiency |
| **Margin Wedge**           |       | Gross margins, unit economics, scale benefits  |
| **Network Effects**        |       | Direct, indirect, data, platform dynamics      |

### Network Effects Deep-Dive

| Type                         | Present? | Strength | Mechanism |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Direct (users attract users) | Y/N      | 1-10     |           |
| Indirect (two-sided)         | Y/N      | 1-10     |           |
| Data (improves with usage)   | Y/N      | 1-10     |           |
| Platform (ecosystem lock-in) | Y/N      | 1-10     |           |

### Blitzscaling Verdict

| Score Range | Verdict                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 32-40       | 🟢 High potential - prioritize speed over efficiency |
| 20-31       | 🟡 Moderate - selective scaling in strong areas      |
| <20         | 🔴 Low - focus on profitability, not blitz           |

## Phase 2: Competitive Threat Analysis

Identify top 3 threats (major players or adjacent competitors):

| Competitor | Threat Level | Rationale (≤25 words) |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| [Name 1]   | High/Med/Low | Why they might enter  |
| [Name 2]   | High/Med/Low | Why they might enter  |
| [Name 3]   | High/Med/Low | Why they might enter  |

### Entry Triggers & Timing

| Competitor | Trigger Event                     | Timing (months) |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Name 1]   | API launch/partnership/regulatory | X months        |
| [Name 2]   |                                   |                 |
| [Name 3]   |                                   |                 |

## Phase 3: Mitigation Strategies

For each threat, one defensive action:

| Competitor | Mitigation Strategy                                              | Implementation |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Name 1]   | Deepen vertical focus / Build community / Exclusive partnerships |                |
| [Name 2]   |                                                                  |                |
| [Name 3]   |                                                                  |                |

## Phase 4: Positioning Statement

Generate a positioning statement:

**For** [target customer]
**Who** [has this problem]
**Our product is** [category]
**That** [key benefit]
**Unlike** [main competitor]
**We** [key differentiator]

## Rules

- Be realistic about threats—investors will ask
- Evidence must be ≤20 words per item
- Timing estimates in months, not vague terms
- Mitigation strategies must be actionable
- Use ask tool to clarify niche/differentiation before analysis
