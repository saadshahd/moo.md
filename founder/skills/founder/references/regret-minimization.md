# Regret Minimization Framework

Project yourself to age 80. Which choice would you regret NOT trying?

---

## When to Use

- Major career decisions (quit job to start company)
- Irreversible life choices
- When fear is blocking action on something important
- Pivoting vs persisting decisions
- Taking a big risk vs playing it safe

---

## The Framework

### The Question

> "When I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life, will I regret NOT trying this?"

### Process

1. **Project forward**: Imagine yourself at 80, looking back
2. **Consider inaction**: What if you never tried?
3. **Consider failure**: What if you tried and failed?
4. **Compare regrets**: Which is worse?

### The Insight

Usually: **Regret of inaction > Regret of failure**

We regret the things we *didn't* do far more than the things we tried and failed at.

## Bezos's Example

> "I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried."

He left a high-paying hedge fund job to start Amazon.

## Application Matrix

| Scenario | Age-80 Regret? | Action |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Safe choice, wonder "what if" forever | HIGH | Take the leap |
| Risky choice that failed, but you learned | LOW | Worth trying |
| Big opportunity, afraid of judgment | HIGH if skipped | Face the fear |
| Incremental improvement, not transformative | LOW either way | Use other frameworks |

---

## When NOT to Use

- Day-to-day decisions (use [10/10/10 Rule](../../../hope/skills/soul/references/tools/10-10-10.md) instead)
- Reversible choices (not high-stakes enough)
- When you're rationalizing recklessness
- Financial decisions that could ruin others

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring responsibilities**: "No regrets" doesn't mean abandoning commitments
- **Survivorship bias**: Bezos succeeded; many don't—have a fallback
- **Romanticizing risk**: Some "safe" paths are genuinely right
