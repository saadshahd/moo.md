# Prep for Investors

Prepare for brutal investor questions that expose weaknesses. No sugar-coating.

## Input Required

Ask for (if not provided):

- Product name and one-liner
- Key metrics (users, revenue, growth rate)
- Biggest risks you're aware of
- Weakest defensible positions
- Funding stage and ask amount

## Phase 1: 10 Brutal Investor Questions

Generate aggressive questions designed to expose flaws. Cover these attack vectors:

| Category           | Example Attack                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Competition**    | "Why won't [BigCo] build this in 6 months and kill you?"          |
| **Unit Economics** | "Your CAC is higher than LTV—when do you run out of money?"       |
| **Market**         | "This market is tiny. How do you get to $100M ARR?"               |
| **Team**           | "You've never done this before. Why should we trust you?"         |
| **Traction**       | "Your growth is slowing. What happens when it flatlines?"         |
| **Defensibility**  | "What stops someone from copying this tomorrow?"                  |
| **Business Model** | "Your pricing is too low/high. Why?"                              |
| **Timing**         | "Why hasn't this worked before? Why now?"                         |
| **Vision**         | "Your vision is too small/big. How do you defend that?"           |
| **Execution**      | "What's the hardest part of this? How do you know you can do it?" |

## Phase 2: Honest Model Answers

For each question, provide:

- **Candid acknowledgment** of the risk (don't deflect)
- **Mitigation** showing you've thought about it
- **Evidence** if available

Format:

| #   | Question   | Honest Answer                                          |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | [Question] | "[Acknowledge risk]. [Mitigation]. [Evidence if any]." |
| 2   | [Question] | "[Acknowledge risk]. [Mitigation]. [Evidence if any]." |
| ... | ...        | ...                                                    |
| 10  | [Question] | "[Acknowledge risk]. [Mitigation]. [Evidence if any]." |

| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| [Issue 1] | High/Med/Low | How to address before they ask |
