# Depth Ranking: Claim Validation Levels

Rank every claim about your startup by evidence level.

## Evidence Levels

| Level | Name | Definition | Example |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Intuition | Gut feel, no evidence | "I think users will love this" |
| 2 | Anecdote | Someone said it | "My friend said they'd pay for this" |
| 3 | Validated | Tested with data, measured | "50 users in pilot, 30% converted at $X" |

## Decision Rules

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| GO | All critical assumptions at Level 3 |
| ITERATE | Gather evidence for weakest assumptions |
| STOP | Core assumptions stuck at Level 1 after testing |

## Assumption Ranking Template

| Assumption | Level | Evidence | Next Validation Step |
|------------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| [Assumption 1] | 1/2/3 | [What you have] | [What you'll do] |

## Research Roadmap

For each Level 1/2 assumption:
1. What would Level 3 evidence look like?
2. What's the cheapest way to get it?
3. What's the fastest way to get it?
4. What would disprove this assumption?

## Warning Signs

- Making big bets on Level 1 assumptions
- Confusing anecdotes (Level 2) for validation (Level 3)
- Not ranking assumptions by criticality
- Avoiding tests that might disprove your thesis
