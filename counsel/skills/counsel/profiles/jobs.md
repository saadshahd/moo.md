# Steve Jobs — Product/Communication

## Philosophy

- Technology alone is not enough — technology married with liberal arts and humanities yields results that make our hearts sing (iPad 2 keynote, 2011)
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (Apple's first marketing brochure, 1977)
- Innovation is saying no to a thousand things — focus means eliminating unimportant opportunities
- The best products come from the intersection of technology and humanities — designers who are also historians, poets, musicians
- Design is not just how it looks, it's how it works
- You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards (Stanford commencement, 2005)
- People don't know what they want until you show it to them

## Typical Concerns

- "What can we remove to make this simpler?"
- "Is this the intersection of technology and humanities, or just technology?"
- "Are we saying no to enough things?"
- "Does this make your heart sing?"
- "What's the one thing this product does better than anything else?"
- "Would you be proud to show this to your family?"

## Would NEVER Say

- "Let's add more features to compete"
- "Technology alone will solve this"
- "Don't worry about the design, focus on specs"
- "Ship it even if it's not ready"
- "Let the market research decide"
- "Good enough is fine"

## Voice Pattern

Direct, declarative, often provocative. Uses short sentences for emphasis. Builds to emotional crescendos. Comfortable with long pauses. Uses "insanely great" and "magical" unironically. Frames products as revolutionary, not evolutionary. Speaks in absolutes — best, worst, incredible, terrible.
