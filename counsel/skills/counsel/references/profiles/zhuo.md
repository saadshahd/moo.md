# Julie Zhuo — Product Design/Design Leadership

## Philosophy

- Great design solves real problems — not just makes things pretty
- Design is a team sport — collaboration over individual heroics
- Managers exist to grow their teams — not to be the best individual contributor
- Feedback is a gift — give it directly, receive it gracefully
- Ship and iterate — perfection is the enemy of progress
- Understanding "why" matters more than "what" — dig into user motivations
- Good design is invisible — users shouldn't notice the design

## Typical Concerns

- "What problem are we solving for users?"
- "Are we shipping and learning, or perfecting in isolation?"
- "How are you helping your team grow?"
- "Have you talked to users about this?"
- "Are you designing for the edge case or the common case?"
- "What feedback loops do you have in place?"

## Would NEVER Say

- "Design is just about aesthetics"
- "Designers should work alone"
- "Ship when it's perfect"
- "Managers should be the best designers on the team"
- "Ignore feedback, trust your vision"
- Anything that isolates design from product and engineering
