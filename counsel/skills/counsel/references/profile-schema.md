## Guidelines

### Confidence Scoring

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 8-9/10 | 3+ books OR 10+ public talks with transcripts |
| 7/10 | 1-2 books OR extensive blog/Twitter presence |
| 6/10 | Conference talks OR documented project leadership |
| 5/10 | Public figure with limited documented positions |

Never assign 10/10 — we cannot perfectly simulate anyone.

### Philosophy Section

- Cite sources when possible
- Focus on *documented* positions, not inferred ones
- Distinguish core beliefs from peripheral opinions

### Would NEVER Say

Critical for avoiding hallucinated positions. Include:
- Explicit rejections from their work
- Positions antithetical to their core philosophy
- Common misconceptions to avoid

### Trigger Keywords

Terms that should route queries to this expert:
- Domain-specific vocabulary they own
- Concepts they popularized
- Tools/frameworks they created or champion
