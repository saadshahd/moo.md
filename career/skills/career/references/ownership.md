# Ownership: Loop 1 vs Loop 2

High-agency framework for career ownership and accountability.

## Diagnostic

| Signal | Loop 1 (Proactive) | Loop 2 (Reactive) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Language | "I will..." | "They should..." |
| Posture | Acting | Waiting |
| Blame | Irrelevant | Central |
| Focus | What I control | What I don't control |
| Energy | Creating | Complaining |
| Timeline | Today | Someday |

## Signs You're in Loop 2

Recognize these patterns:

- Waiting for someone else to act first
- Blaming circumstances or others
- Spectating your own career
- "I can't because they..."
- Feeling stuck without clear reason
- Rehearsing conversations you'll never have
- Gathering evidence for why it's not your fault
- Explaining instead of executing

## Loop Shift Exercise

When stuck in Loop 2, ask:

1. **What am I waiting for?**
   - Name it explicitly

2. **What would I do if that never came?**
   - Remove the external dependency

3. **What's the smallest Loop 1 action available right now?**
   - Something you control completely

## Regional Execution

Break down to ownable chunks:

### Control Audit

| Category | Examples | Your Items |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Direct Control** | Your effort, your learning, your communication | [List yours] |
| **Can Influence** | Your manager's perception, team priorities | [List yours] |
| **Cannot Control** | Company reorgs, market conditions, others' decisions | [List yours] |

### Focus Protocol

1. **What's the smallest action you can take TODAY?**
   - Not this week. Today.

2. **What's in your direct control?**
   - If it requires someone else's approval, it's influence, not control

3. **Who can you influence (not control)?**
   - Influence requires action from you first

4. **What would you do if you HAD to act?**
   - Remove all "waiting for" and "if only" conditions

## Accountability Framework

For each commitment:

| Element | Definition | Your Commitment |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **WHAT** | Specific deliverable | [Describe concretely] |
| **BY WHEN** | Date and time | [Exact deadline] |
| **METRIC** | How you'll know it's done | [Observable evidence] |
| **CONSEQUENCE** | What happens if you don't | [Real stake] |

### Accountability Partner Protocol

Share your commitment with someone who will:

- Ask "Did you do it?" on the deadline
- Not accept excuses
- Not help you rationalize
- Care enough to be uncomfortable

## Agency Debugger

When you're stuck, diagnose the real blocker:

| Blocker | Symptoms | Prescription |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Clarity** | Don't know what to do next | Write down 3 possible actions, pick smallest |
| **Skill Gap** | Don't know HOW to do it | Find one person who's done it, ask how |
| **Fear** | Know what, avoiding it | Name the fear, take smallest courageous action |
| **Energy** | Depleted, everything feels heavy | Rest first, then smallest possible action |
| **Audience** | No one will see or care | Tell one person what you're doing today |
| **Accountability** | No consequence for inaction | Create a stake—tell someone, set a deadline |

### Prescription Template

ONE action for next 60 minutes that:

- Addresses actual blocker (not generic productivity)
- Produces an artifact (email sent, document written, conversation had)
- Has someone who will see it today
- Is small enough you can't talk yourself out of it

### Resistance Reveals

If you resist the prescription, that resistance tells you the real blocker.

- Resist clarity exercise? You're afraid of what you'll find
- Resist asking for help? Pride or fear of judgment
- Resist telling someone? You're not committed yet
- Resist the deadline? You don't believe it matters

## Output Format

```
## Ownership Audit

### Current Loop Assessment

**Loop:** 1 / 2
**Evidence:** [What language/behavior indicates this]

### If Loop 2, Shift Required

**What I'm waiting for:** [External dependency]
**What I'd do if it never came:** [Self-sufficient action]
**Smallest Loop 1 action:** [Immediate step]

### Control Audit

**Direct Control:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

**Can Influence:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

**Cannot Control (stop spending energy here):**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Accountability Commitment

| WHAT | BY WHEN | METRIC | CONSEQUENCE |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| [Deliverable] | [Date/time] | [Evidence] | [Stake] |

### Agency Debug (if stuck)

**Blocker:** [Clarity / Skill / Fear / Energy / Audience / Accountability]
**Prescription:** [60-minute action]
**Artifact:** [What will exist after]
**Witness:** [Who will see it]
```

## Rules

- Loop 2 is human; staying there is a choice
- "I can't" usually means "I won't"
- Accountability without stakes is wishful thinking
- Resistance to the prescription reveals the real blocker
- Smallest action beats perfect plan
