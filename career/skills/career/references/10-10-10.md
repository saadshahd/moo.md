# 10/10/10 Rule

Evaluate decisions across three time horizons: How will I feel in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?

---

## When to Use

- Daily decisions that feel urgent
- When emotion is clouding judgment
- Short-term pain vs long-term gain tradeoffs
- Procrastination vs action decisions
- Any decision where time perspective helps

---

## The Framework

### Three Questions

| Timeframe | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **10 minutes** | How will I feel immediately after this decision? |
| **10 months** | How will I feel about this in 10 months? |
| **10 years** | How will I feel about this in 10 years? |

### Decision Matrix

```
                10 min    10 months    10 years
Option A:       [feeling] [feeling]    [feeling]
Option B:       [feeling] [feeling]    [feeling]
```

Choose the option that optimizes for longer timeframes.

## Examples

### Example 1: Difficult Conversation

**Decision**: Give critical feedback to colleague?

| Timeframe | Avoid Feedback | Give Feedback |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| 10 min | Relief | Uncomfortable |
| 10 months | Relationship strained, problem persists | Relationship stronger, problem solved |
| 10 years | Regret not helping | Proud of integrity |

**Answer**: Give the feedback. Short-term discomfort, long-term benefit.

---

### Example 2: Skip the Gym

**Decision**: Skip workout because tired?

| Timeframe | Skip | Go |
|-----------|------|-----|
| 10 min | Relief | Effort required |
| 10 months | Fitness declined | Habit established |
| 10 years | Health problems | Healthy, energetic |

**Answer**: Go. The 10-minute feeling is a trap.

---

### Example 3: Take the Safe Job vs Risky Startup

| Timeframe | Safe Job | Risky Startup |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 10 min | Secure | Anxious |
| 10 months | Bored but stable | Stressed but learning |
| 10 years | Wonder "what if" | Either succeeded or learned massively |

**Answer**: Often the startup—10-year regret of inaction outweighs failure.

## Key Insight

**Short-term feelings are poor predictors of long-term satisfaction.**

We overweight:
- Immediate discomfort
- Social awkwardness
- Effort required now

We underweight:
- Compound effects
- Future regret
- Growth from difficulty

---

## Quick Decision Filter

When stuck, ask:

> "Will this matter in 10 years?"

- **Yes** → Give it proper weight
- **No** → Stop agonizing, decide quickly

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **All short-term**: Always choosing comfort
- **All long-term**: Ignoring legitimate present needs
- **Paralysis**: Overanalyzing trivial decisions
- **Ignoring context**: Some decisions genuinely are short-term only
