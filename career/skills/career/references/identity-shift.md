# Identity Shift: Role Transition Framework

For transitions between roles (IC to Manager, Engineer to PM, etc.)

## Input Required

Use Ask tool to gather:

1. **Current Role:** Title, responsibilities, what you're known for
2. **Target Role:** What you're transitioning to
3. **Timeline:** When this needs to happen
4. **Context:** Internal move, new company, or gradual shift

## Current State Inventory

Map current competencies with evidence:

| Competency | Evidence of Proficiency | Transfer Status |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| [Skill 1] | [Specific examples] | TRANSFERS / PARTIAL / NEW NEEDED |
| [Skill 2] | [Specific examples] | TRANSFERS / PARTIAL / NEW NEEDED |
| [Skill 3] | [Specific examples] | TRANSFERS / PARTIAL / NEW NEEDED |

### Transfer Status Definitions

- **TRANSFERS:** Directly applicable in new role
- **PARTIAL:** Applicable but needs adaptation
- **NEW NEEDED:** Must build from scratch

## Target Role Requirements

| Requirement | Current Level | Target Level | Gap | Evidence Needed |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| [Skill 1] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [Delta] | [What would prove competency] |
| [Skill 2] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [Delta] | [What would prove competency] |
| [Skill 3] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [Delta] | [What would prove competency] |

## Gap Analysis

For each gap identified:

### Gap 1: [Skill Name]

**What transfers directly:**
- [Existing skill/experience that applies]

**What's completely new:**
- [Concept or practice you've never done]

**How to credibly lead while learning:**
- [Approach to maintain trust during ramp-up]

## Learning Plan

| Milestone | Timeframe | Evidence of Completion | Checkpoint |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| [Milestone 1] | [When] | [Observable artifact] | [How to verify] |
| [Milestone 2] | [When] | [Observable artifact] | [How to verify] |
| [Milestone 3] | [When] | [Observable artifact] | [How to verify] |

## Identity Questions

Before transitioning, answer honestly:

1. **What expertise transfers?** (Don't lose this)
   - Your answer determines what to emphasize, not abandon

2. **What's genuinely new?** (Don't fake this)
   - Pretending competence destroys trust faster than admitting gaps

3. **How to credibly lead where you're still learning?** (Transparent growth)
   - "I'm learning X, here's my plan" beats false confidence

4. **What identity are you letting go of?**
   - The expert IC, the individual contributor, the technical authority

5. **What new identity are you building?**
   - The multiplier, the decision-maker, the people developer

## Common Transition Patterns

### IC to Manager

| Letting Go | Building |
|------------|----------|
| Being the best doer | Enabling the best doing |
| Direct contribution | Indirect impact |
| Technical depth | People depth |
| "I did it" | "They did it" |

### Engineer to PM

| Letting Go | Building |
|------------|----------|
| Building solutions | Defining problems |
| Technical correctness | Business value |
| Implementation details | Customer outcomes |
| "How" focus | "Why" and "What" focus |

### Individual Contributor to Leader

| Letting Go | Building |
|------------|----------|
| Personal productivity | Team productivity |
| Solving problems yourself | Creating problem-solvers |
| Being right | Getting to right together |
| Your calendar | Their growth |

## Output Format

```
## Identity Shift Analysis

### Current State

**Role:** [Current title and context]
**Known For:** [What you're recognized for]
**Core Competencies:**
[Inventory table]

### Target State

**Role:** [Target title]
**Required Competencies:**
[Requirements table]

### Gap Analysis

**Gap 1:** [Name]
- Transfers: [What applies]
- New: [What to build]
- Bridge: [How to credibly grow]

[Repeat for each significant gap]

### Identity Transition

**Letting Go:**
- [Old identity element 1]
- [Old identity element 2]

**Building:**
- [New identity element 1]
- [New identity element 2]

### 90-Day Learning Plan

| Month | Focus | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | [Primary gap to close] | [Artifact to produce] |
| 2 | [Secondary gap] | [Artifact to produce] |
| 3 | [Integration] | [Artifact to produce] |

### First Week Actions

1. [Immediate action to signal transition]
2. [Learning activity to close biggest gap]
3. [Relationship to build in new role]
```

## Rules

- Honest gap assessment prevents painful surprises
- "Partial transfer" skills need explicit adaptation plans
- Identity questions surface emotional resistance early
- Learning plan milestones must have observable evidence
- First week actions create momentum before doubt sets in
