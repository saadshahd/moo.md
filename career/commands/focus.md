description: Analyze focus capacity using λ/Δ/θ model OR calculate true cost of meetings. Two modes for deep work optimization.
---

Use the career skill's Focus Capacity workflow exactly as written in `references/focus.md`.

**Mode 1 (Parameter Estimation):** Interview to estimate personal λ (interruptions/hour), Δ (recovery time), θ (minimum focus block). Calculate realistic deep work capacity and identify highest-leverage change.

**Mode 2 (Meeting Cost):** Analyze specific meeting with direct time, fragmentation, and context-switch costs. Calculate value threshold and suggest alternatives.

Ask which mode user wants, then proceed with appropriate analysis.
