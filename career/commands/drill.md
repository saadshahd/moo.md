description: Transform messy real-world situations into focused 15-30 minute practice drills. Identifies target skill, defines artifact, and evaluates results.
---

Use the career skill's Practice Drill workflow exactly as written in `references/drill.md`.

Ask for the messy situation (Slack thread, vague request, stuck project, etc.). Then:
- Identify which skill the situation demands (judgment, orchestration, coordination, taste, updating, synthesis, framing)
- Define a constrained artifact to produce (type, time limit, word limit, required sections)
- Set success criteria
- Evaluate submitted artifact against criteria
- Suggest next drill based on performance
