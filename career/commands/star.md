Use the career skill's STAR-C Narrative workflow exactly as written in `references/star.md`.

Ask for experience bullets, target role, and key competencies. Transform each into:
- STAR-C format (Situation, Task, Action, Result, Constraint reflection)
- Evidence tags ([FACT], [INFERENCE], [OPINION], [TK-VERIFY])
- AI integration disclosure where relevant
- Evidence strength rating and recommended interview contexts
