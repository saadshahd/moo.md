description: Generate 3 radically different perspectives on any career challenge. Breaks mental ruts with reframes, metaphors, and implementation bridges.
---

Use the career skill's Perspective Shift workflow exactly as written in `references/reframe.md`.

Gather the challenge, current approach, and constraints. Then generate 3 perspectives (practical to radical), each with:
- Reframe title and core insight
- Vivid 100-150 word story
- Memorable metaphor
- Action tagline under 12 words

Include implementation bridge for most practical option (tomorrow's step, metric, obstacle handling).
