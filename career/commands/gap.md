Use the career skill's Gap Analysis workflow exactly as written in `references/gap.md`.

Ask for evaluated documents (decision docs, specs, exec updates, etc.) with scores and feedback. Then:
- Identify recurring low scores and feedback themes
- Distinguish surface vs deep issues
- Prioritize by impact × frequency × fixability × leverage
- Diagnose root cause (skill, habit, feedback, or judgment gap)
- Suggest specific practice exercises for top weaknesses
