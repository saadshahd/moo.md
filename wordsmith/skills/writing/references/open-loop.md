# Open Loop

Make messages memorable using the Zeigarnik effect—incomplete loops demand closure.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Use This Framework |
|---------|-------------------|
| Writing copy that needs to stick | Create tension that lingers |
| Presentations to busy audiences | Hook attention, hold memory |
| Emails that require action | Leave something unresolved |

## The Framework

       │    └───────────┘                            │
       │                                             │

The Zeigarnik Effect: Incomplete tasks are remembered
70% better than completed ones. Use this.
```

## How to Apply

1. **Answer first:** State your main point clearly
2. **Bridge emotionally:** Connect to something they care about
3. **Leave unfinished:** End with an open question, a "what if", or an unresolved tension

**The key:** Resist the urge to wrap everything up neatly. Leave one thread dangling.

## Open Loop Techniques

| Technique | How It Works | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **The Cliff** | Stop mid-story | "And that's when everything changed..." |
| **The Question** | End with curiosity | "The only question is: will you be ready?" |
| **The Gap** | Reveal incompleteness | "Three things make this work. Today we cover two." |
| **The Promise** | Defer the payoff | "The real secret comes after you try this." |

## Example

**Topic:** New feature announcement

**Closed Loop (forgettable):**
> We're launching dark mode. It reduces eye strain by 40%. Enable it in Settings → Display. You'll love it.

**Open Loop (memorable):**
> We're launching dark mode. It reduces eye strain by 40%.
>
> But here's what we didn't expect: the teams testing it started using it for something else entirely.
>
> Enable it in Settings → Display. Then tell us what *you* discover.

## Anti-Patterns

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Too many open loops | Confusion, not curiosity |
| Fake cliffhangers | Trust erodes quickly |
| Never closing any loops | Frustration builds |
| Opening loops you can't close | Broken promises |

## Key Insight

Completion feels good but is forgotten. Incompletion is uncomfortable but remembered. The discomfort is the point—it drives action.
