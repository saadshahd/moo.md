description: Generate alternative framings for a stuck problem. Transforms constraints into advantages, shifts perspectives, finds overlooked solution spaces.

# /reframe

Unstick a problem by reframing it. Find new solution spaces.

## Phase 1: Capture Current Framing

Document how the problem is currently viewed:
- Problem statement (exact words matter)
- Assumed constraints
- Attempted solutions
- Why it feels stuck

## Phase 2: Generate Alternative Framings

Apply 7 reframing techniques:

### 1. Inversion (Opposite Day)
- Instead of "How do we solve X?", ask "How do we prevent X?"
- Instead of "How do we add Y?", ask "How do we remove not-Y?"
- Instead of "How do we go faster?", ask "What should we stop doing?"

### 2. Constraint Reversal
- Pick the biggest constraint
- Ask: "What if this constraint were the solution?"
- Example: "Limited budget" → "How does a tiny budget make this better?"

### 3. User Journey Shift
- Current frame focuses on what user?
- Reframe for: power user, beginner, admin, future self
- What does each one actually need?

### 4. Time Travel
- 10 years ago: How would they have solved this?
- 10 years future: What will seem obvious then?
- 1 hour before deadline: What's the absolute minimum?

### 5. Domain Transfer
- How would [different industry] approach this?
- Hospitality / Manufacturing / Sports / Military
- What metaphors apply?

### 6. Assumption Questioning
- List every "must" and "should" in problem statement
- Ask: "What if we didn't have to?"
- Find the sacred cow and question it

### 7. Meta-Problem
- What problem is this problem a symptom of?
- What would disappear if we solved the real problem?
- Are we solving the right problem?

## Phase 3: Solution Space Mapping

For each reframing that resonates:

```
## Reframing: [New perspective]

### What this unlocks
- [Solution approach 1]
- [Solution approach 2]
- [Solution approach 3]

### Tradeoffs
- Gain: [what becomes easier]
- Cost: [what becomes harder]

### Confidence: X-Y%
[Why this framing might work]
```

## Phase 4: Synthesis

Present findings:

```
## Original Framing
[Current problem statement]

## Alternative Framings (ranked by promise)

### 1. [Reframing technique]: [New problem statement]
**Unlocks:** [solution space]
**Tradeoff:** [what changes]
**Confidence:** X-Y% (evidence: [why this might work])

### 2. [Next best reframing]
...

### 3. [Third option]
...

## Recommended Next Step
[Which reframing to explore first and why]

```

## Phase 5: Wait

**Do not implement solutions.** Present reframings and wait for user to select direction.
