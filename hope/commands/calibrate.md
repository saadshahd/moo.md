# /calibrate

**Status:** Deferred — requires `predictions.jsonl` (see ADR-001)

This command analyzes prediction accuracy from `~/.claude/learnings/predictions.jsonl`.

Currently non-functional. No automated mechanism writes predictions. See `docs/adrs/001-predictions-deferred.md` for context and future options.
