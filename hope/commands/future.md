description: Run regret minimization analysis on a major decision. Projects to age 80 to evaluate what you'll regret not doing.
---

# /future

Analyze a major decision through the lens of future regret. Clarity from the deathbed.

## Phase 1: Decision Context

Capture the decision:
- What are you deciding between? (be specific)
- What's the default path (what happens if you do nothing)?
- What's the timeline?
- What makes this decision feel significant?

## Phase 2: Regret Minimization Framework

Project to age 80 and evaluate each option:

### For each option, ask:

**1. Regret of Action**
- Will I regret doing this?
- What's the worst outcome if I choose this?
- Will this matter in 1 year? 5 years? 20 years?
- What becomes irreversible?

**2. Regret of Inaction**
- Will I regret NOT doing this?
- What opportunity dies if I don't act?
- What will I wonder about forever?
- What story will I not have?

**3. Dignity Test**
- Can I explain this decision to my 80-year-old self?
- Is this fear-driven or values-driven?
- Would I be proud to tell this story?
- Does this align with who I want to become?

**4. Opportunity Cost**
- What am I saying "no" to by choosing this?
- What doors close? What doors open?
- What becomes easier/harder next?
- What precedent does this set for future decisions?

## Phase 3: Time Horizon Analysis

Evaluate across multiple timeframes:

```
## Option A: [Choice]

### 1 year out
- Likely outcome: [realistic projection]
- Best case: [optimistic]
- Worst case: [pessimistic]
- Regret probability: X%

### 5 years out
- Likely outcome: [projection]
- Reversibility: [can you undo this?]
- Regret probability: X%

### 20 years out (age 80 perspective)
- Will this matter? [yes/no + why]
- Story worth telling? [yes/no]
- Regret probability: X%
```

## Phase 4: Comparison Matrix

```
## Regret Analysis

|                          | Option A | Option B | Default (Do Nothing) |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| **Action Regret**        | X%       | Y%       | Z%                   |
| **Inaction Regret**      | X%       | Y%       | Z%                   |
| **Net Regret (higher=worse)** | N%  | N%       | N%                   |
| **Passes Dignity Test**  | Yes/No   | Yes/No   | Yes/No               |
| **Reversible**           | Type     | Type     | Type                 |

### Key Insights
1. [Insight about regret patterns]
2. [Insight about irreversibility]
3. [Insight about values alignment]
```

## Phase 5: Synthesis

```
## Recommendation (from age 80)

**Choose:** [Option]

**Because:**
- [Primary reason based on regret analysis]
- [Secondary reason]
- [Values alignment]

**Warning:**
- [What to watch for]
- [How to know if this was wrong]
- [Reversibility plan if available]

**At age 80, you will likely:**
- [Prediction about how you'll feel about this decision]

---
Confidence: X-Y% (evidence: [basis for analysis])
Key Assumption: [what values/priorities this assumes]
Reversible: Type [2A/2B/1]
Complexity: X story points (to execute choice)
```

## Phase 6: Wait

**Do not make the decision.** Present analysis and wait for user to choose.

This is a framework for thinking, not a replacement for judgment.
