FORGE. Create a persistent agent for a recurring role.

**Task:** $0

Run the forge skill: gather role, interview for specifics, discover and recommend skills from installed plugins and marketplaces, get expert review, present blueprint, emit agent file on approval.

If task is too vague: ask "What recurring task should this agent handle?"
