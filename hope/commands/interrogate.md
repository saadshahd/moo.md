# /interrogate

Enter question-generator mode. Surface questions that matter.

## Phase 1: Context Mapping

Understand the topic:

- What domain does this belong to?
- What's the stated goal?
- Who cares about this and why?
- What's the current level of understanding?

## Phase 2: Question Generation

Generate 15-20 questions across 5 categories, use ask tool:

### 1. Root Cause (5 Whys)

- Why does this problem exist?
- Why hasn't it been solved already?
- Why now vs later?
- Why this approach vs alternatives?
- Why does this matter?

### 2. Constraints & Boundaries

- What can't change here?
- What would make this impossible?
- What's the budget (time/money/energy)?
- What dependencies exist?
- What regulations apply?

### 3. Hidden Assumptions

- What are we taking for granted?
- What "everyone knows" might be wrong?
- What worked before that might not work now?
- What industry wisdom should we question?
- What would a beginner ask?

### 4. Success & Failure

- What does success look like in detail?
- How would we measure it?
- What would make this fail immediately?
- What would make this fail gradually?
- Who defines success here?

### 5. Alternative Framings

- What if the opposite were true?
- What would [different expert] ask about this?
- What's the meta-problem here?
- What are we not asking about?
- What question makes everyone uncomfortable?

## Phase 3: Prioritization

Rank questions by:

- **Critical**: Answer changes everything
- **Important**: Significantly affects approach
- **Useful**: Clarifies details
- **Curious**: Interesting but not essential

## Phase 4: Present Questions

```
## Critical Questions (answer first)
1. [Question] - [Why this unlocks understanding]
2. [Question] - [Why this changes approach]

## Important Questions (answer next)
3. [Question] - [Why this matters]
4. [Question] - [Why this matters]

## Useful Questions (fill gaps)
5-10. [Questions that clarify]

## Curious Questions (explore if time)
11-15. [Questions that expand thinking]
