# /mirror

Analyze blind spots in a decision or situation. Surface what you might be missing.

## Phase 1: Context Capture

State the situation clearly:
- Core decision or situation
- Current framing
- Stakeholders involved
- Timeline/urgency

## Phase 2: Blind Spot Detection

Examine 5 categories systematically:

### 1. Assumptions Audit
- What am I treating as fact without verification?
- Which "always" or "never" statements exist?
- What would someone from outside my field question immediately?

### 2. Incentive Analysis
- Who benefits if this succeeds?
- Who benefits if this fails?
- What incentives am I overlooking?
- What conflicts of interest exist?

### 3. Missing Perspectives
- Who's not in the room but should be?
- What expertise is absent?
- Which user segments am I ignoring?
- What would [specific role] say about this?

### 4. Second-Order Effects
- What happens after the immediate consequence?
- Which systems interact with this decision?
- What precedent does this set?
- What becomes easier/harder next?

### 5. Emotion vs Logic
- What am I avoiding out of discomfort?
- Which decisions feel "obvious" (beware)?
- What would I do if fear/ego were removed?
- Am I solving the stated problem or my anxiety about it?

## Phase 3: Red Team

Play devil's advocate:
- Steel-man the opposite decision
- List 3 ways this could fail spectacularly
- Identify what would make you reverse this decision in 6 months

## Phase 4: Synthesis

Present findings:

```
## Blind Spots Detected

### Critical (address before proceeding)
- [Blind spot]: [Why it matters] - [How to verify]

### Significant (monitor closely)
- [Blind spot]: [Why it matters] - [Mitigation]

### Minor (acknowledge)
- [Blind spot]: [Why it matters]

## Questions to Answer
1. [Question that would resolve uncertainty]
2. [Question that tests assumption]
3. [Question that surfaces risk]

## Phase 5: Wait

**Do not recommend action.** Present blind spots and wait for user direction.
