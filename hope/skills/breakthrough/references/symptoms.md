# Symptom-Based Technique Dispatch

Match your symptom to the right technique.

## Primary Dispatch Table

| Symptom | Technique | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Problem feels too big | Simplification Cascade | Breaks overwhelming scope into digestible pieces |
| Solution feels over-engineered | Scale Game | Extremes reveal essential vs. accidental complexity |
| "This shouldn't be this hard" | Meta-Pattern Recognition | You're solving the wrong problem class |
| All options seem bad | Assumption Inversion | Hidden constraint blocking all paths |
| Stuck on specific constraint | Constraint Removal | Mental unlock by temporarily removing barrier |
| Can't see the forest | Fresh Perspective | Reset mental model through externalization |

## Secondary Symptoms

More granular symptom matching:

| Symptom | Technique | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Don't know where to start | Simplification Cascade | Find the smallest working version |
| Every approach feels hacky | Scale Game | You're at wrong abstraction level |
| Reinventing the wheel | Meta-Pattern Recognition | Someone solved this; find them |
| "We have to do X" (but X blocks) | Assumption Inversion | Challenge the "have to" |
| "If only I could change Y" | Constraint Removal | Test if Y is truly immutable |
| Overthinking | Fresh Perspective | Step back and externalize |
| Analysis paralysis | Fresh Perspective | Draw it or explain to rubber duck |
| Can't explain what's wrong | Fresh Perspective | Teaching reveals gaps |
| Requirements seem contradictory | Assumption Inversion | Hidden assumption creating false conflict |
| Solution works but feels fragile | Scale Game | Test at extreme scales |
| Weeks of no progress | Simplification + Meta-Pattern | Reset fundamentally |

## Emotional Signals

Sometimes the feeling points to the technique:

| Feeling | Likely Technique | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Overwhelmed | Simplification Cascade | Scope too large |
| Frustrated | Meta-Pattern Recognition | Wrong framing |
| Trapped | Assumption Inversion | Hidden constraint |
| Scattered | Fresh Perspective | Need distance |
| Embarrassed | Meta-Pattern Recognition | Missing obvious solution class |
| Stubborn | Constraint Removal | Clinging to false constraint |

## Combination Symptoms

When multiple symptoms present:

| Symptom Combo | Start With | Chain To |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| Big + over-engineered | Simplification Cascade | Scale Game |
| All bad + specific blocker | Assumption Inversion | Constraint Removal |
| Can't see + too big | Fresh Perspective | Simplification Cascade |
| Shouldn't be hard + trapped | Meta-Pattern | Assumption Inversion |
| Over-engineered + can't explain | Scale Game | Fresh Perspective |
