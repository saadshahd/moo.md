# Tool Pairings

Common combinations for complex problems. Tools work better together.

## Primary Pairings

| Primary Tool | Pairs With | Use Case |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Pre-Mortem | Deliberate Practice | Practice drills for failure modes |
| Pre-Mortem | Feedback Loops | Learn from drill outcomes |
| Bayesian Thinking | Pre-Mortem | Update priors from failure analysis |
| Circle of Competence | Sunk Cost | Know when to exit outside expertise |
| Grey Thinking | Steel Man + Decision Matrix | Multi-perspective evaluation |
| Systems Over Goals | Feedback Loops | Design habit systems with measurement |
| Munger's 25 | Confidence Gates | Run bias check before claiming ≥85% |
| Opportunity Cost | Eisenhower + Impact-Effort | Weigh hidden costs when prioritizing |
| Chesterton's Fence | Second-Order Thinking | Understand before removing |

## Pairing Logic

### Analysis → Action
Start with analysis tools, end with action tools:

```
Ishikawa (root cause)
    → First Principles (decompose)
    → Decision Matrix (choose)
    → Pre-Mortem (anticipate failure)
```

### Zoom Out → Zoom In
Start broad, narrow down:

```
Cynefin (domain classification)
    → Issue Trees (decomposition)
    → Impact-Effort (prioritization)
    → Feedback Loops (measurement)
```

### Challenge → Validate
Test assumptions before committing:

```
Steel Man (strongest counter)
    → Grey Thinking (avoid binary)
    → Bayesian (update priors)
    → Decision Matrix (final choice)
```

## Workflow-Specific Pairings

### Workflow A (Build)
```
Intent Check
    → Issue Trees (decomposition)
    → Impact-Effort (prioritization)
    → Pre-Mortem (failure modes)
```

### Workflow B (Debug)
```
Ishikawa (root cause)
    → Five Whys (drill down)
    → First Principles (verify assumptions)
    → Feedback Loops (prevent recurrence)
```

### Workflow C (Refactor)
```
Chesterton's Fence (understand why)
    → Second-Order Thinking (consequences)
    → Cynefin (complexity assessment)
    → Systems Over Goals (sustainable change)
```

## Anti-Pairings

Tools that don't combine well:

| Avoid Combining | Reason |
|-----------------|--------|
| Eisenhower + Decision Matrix | Redundant prioritization |
| Pre-Mortem + Ishikawa | Pre-mortem is future, Ishikawa is past |
| Grey Thinking + Hard Choice | Grey Thinking seeks middle, Hard Choice forces binary |

## When to Pair

- **Single tool sufficient** → Simple, well-defined problem
- **Two tools** → Moderate complexity, needs validation
- **Three+ tools** → High stakes, multiple perspectives needed
- **Never more than four** → Diminishing returns, analysis paralysis
