# Altitude: Strategic Deep-Diving

Know when to zoom in vs zoom out.

## Altitude Levels

| Level | Focus | Questions |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **30,000 ft** | Vision | Why does this exist? What's the end state? |
| **10,000 ft** | Strategy | What's the approach? What are the tradeoffs? |
| **1,000 ft** | Tactics | How do we implement? What's the sequence? |
| **Ground** | Execution | What's the next action? What's blocking? |

## Altitude Mismatch Symptoms

| Symptom | Likely Issue |
|---------|--------------|
| Endless debates | Wrong altitude (strategy when need tactics) |
| Premature optimization | Too low too soon |
| Analysis paralysis | Stuck at 30k ft |
| Thrashing | Jumping altitudes randomly |
| Missing forest for trees | Never zoom out |

## When to Change Altitude

**Zoom Out When:**
- Implementation feels wrong but you can't say why
- Solving symptoms, not root cause
- Lost sight of the goal
- Team misaligned on direction

**Zoom In When:**
- Strategy is clear, need execution plan
- Blocked on specific technical question
- Need to validate assumptions concretely
- Time to ship

## Altitude Hygiene

1. **Name your altitude** - "Let's stay at 10k ft for this discussion"
2. **Match the meeting** - Standups = ground, planning = 1k-10k, offsites = 10k-30k
3. **One altitude per conversation** - Don't mix strategy and implementation
4. **Explicit transitions** - "Let me zoom out for a second..."

## Strategic Depth Ranking

Claims have different evidence levels:

| Level | Name | Confidence |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Intuition | Gut feel, unvalidated |
| 2 | Anecdote | Someone said, limited data |
| 3 | Validated | Tested, measured, proven |

**Rule:** Don't make 30k ft decisions on Level 1 evidence.
