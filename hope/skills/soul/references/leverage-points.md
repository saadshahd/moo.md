# Leverage Points

Identify where to intervene in a system for maximum effect—Donella Meadows' hierarchy.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Use This Framework |
|---------|-------------------|
| Complex system needs change | Find highest-leverage intervention |
| Multiple intervention options | Prioritize by impact potential |
| Past changes didn't stick | May be intervening at wrong level |

## The 12 Leverage Points

### Low Leverage (Easy but Weak)

| # | Point | Description | Example |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Parameters** | Constants, numbers | Changing tax rate by 1% |
| 2 | **Buffers** | Stabilizing stocks | Bigger inventory |

### Medium Leverage (Moderate Effort, Moderate Impact)

| # | Point | Description | Example |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 3 | **Stock-Flow Structure** | Physical infrastructure | Redesigning supply chain |
| 4 | **Delays** | Time between cause/effect | Faster feedback cycles |
| 5 | **Balancing Loops** | Negative feedback | Adding quality checks |
| 6 | **Reinforcing Loops** | Positive feedback | Viral growth mechanism |
| 7 | **Information Flows** | Who knows what when | Transparent dashboards |
| 8 | **Rules** | Incentives, constraints, permissions | Changing approval process |

### High Leverage (Hard but Powerful)

| # | Point | Description | Example |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 9 | **Self-Organization** | System's ability to evolve | Enabling experimentation |
| 10 | **Goals** | Purpose of the system | Redefining success metrics |
| 11 | **Paradigm** | Mindset the system operates from | Shifting from "growth" to "sustainability" |
| 12 | **Transcending Paradigms** | Ability to change paradigms | Meta-awareness |

## How to Apply

1. **Map the system:** What are the key stocks, flows, and feedback loops?
2. **Identify current intervention level:** Where are you/others trying to change things?
3. **Look one level up:** Could you intervene at a higher leverage point?
4. **Assess difficulty vs. impact:** Higher leverage = harder but more durable change
5. **Match intervention to goal:** Quick fix → low leverage. Lasting change → high leverage.

## Example

**Topic:** Reducing employee burnout

```
CURRENT INTERVENTIONS (Low Leverage)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Level 1 (Parameters): "Work max 45 hours/week"
Level 2 (Buffers): "Hire more people"

WHY THEY FAIL
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
These address symptoms, not causes.
Workload just redistributes or rules get ignored.

HIGHER LEVERAGE ANALYSIS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Level 4 (Delays): Speed up promotion decisions
  → People leave before decisions are made

Level 6 (R-Loops): Break "hero culture" reinforcement
  → Burnout → praise → more burnout

Level 7 (Info Flows): Make workload visible to leadership
  → Leaders don't see the problem

Level 8 (Rules): Change how work is assigned
  → Strongest people get all the work

Level 10 (Goals): Redefine success = output, not hours
  → The real paradigm shift

RECOMMENDED INTERVENTION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Start: Level 7 (Info flows) - make invisible work visible
  → Dashboard showing load distribution

Then: Level 8 (Rules) - change assignment mechanism
  → Capacity-aware work allocation

Eventually: Level 10 (Goals) - redefine success metrics
  → Measure outcomes, not effort
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Result | Correction |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Defaulting to parameters | Temporary relief, problem returns | Ask "what reinforces this?" |
| Jumping to paradigm shift | Too abstract, no traction | Work your way up gradually |
| Ignoring delays | Impatience, abandoning solutions | Allow time for effects |
| Changing rules without info | Rules get gamed | Info flows before rules |

## Key Insight

Most interventions happen at levels 1-3 (parameters, buffers, structure) because they're visible and easy. The leverage is at levels 7-10 (info, rules, goals, paradigms) but they're invisible and hard. The gap between where we intervene and where we should intervene is where change fails.
