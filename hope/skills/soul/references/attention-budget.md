# Attention Budget

Filter work through value creation lens.

## Categories

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **CORE** | Directly creates value customers pay for | Protect ruthlessly |
| **ENABLING** | Necessary but not differentiating | Delegate or buy |
| **OVERHEAD** | Neither creates nor enables value | Minimize or eliminate |

## Classification Test

For each activity, ask:

1. Would customers pay more if we did this better? → CORE
2. Would we lose customers if we stopped? → ENABLING
3. Neither? → OVERHEAD

## Audit Protocol

Weekly attention audit:

1. **List** — All activities from past week
2. **Classify** — CORE / ENABLING / OVERHEAD
3. **Measure** — Hours spent per category
4. **Target** — Ideal split for your role

| Role | CORE | ENABLING | OVERHEAD |
|------|------|----------|----------|
| IC Maker | 70%+ | 20% | <10% |
| Manager | 50%+ | 30% | <20% |
| Executive | 40%+ | 40% | <20% |

## Biggest Bleed Identification

Find where attention leaks:

| Bleed Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---------------|---------|-----|
| OVERHEAD disguised as CORE | "Strategic planning" that produces nothing | Time-box, require deliverable |
| ENABLING consuming CORE time | Building tools instead of product | Buy, delegate, or accept "good enough" |
| Context switching | Fragmented focus, no deep work | Batch similar tasks, protect blocks |
| Meetings without decisions | Calendar full, progress slow | Require agenda, skip if none |

## Forcing Question

For any task consuming >1 hour:

> "If I could only do ONE thing this week, would it be this?"

If no → it's not CORE. Either delegate, defer, or delete.

## Reallocation Options

When OVERHEAD/ENABLING exceeds budget:

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Automate** | Repetitive, predictable, stable |
| **Delegate** | Requires human judgment, not yours specifically |
| **Buy** | Commodity, others do it better |
| **Accept debt** | Temporary, with explicit payback plan |
| **Stop doing** | Value < cost, nobody will notice |

## Anti-Patterns

| Trap | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Everything is CORE" | If everything is priority, nothing is |
| "I'll delegate when I have time" | You won't; delegate now |
| "Only I can do this" | Train someone or accept bottleneck |
| "It's only 15 minutes" | 15 min × 20 = full day |
