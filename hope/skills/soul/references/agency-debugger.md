Diagnostic for "why am I stuck?"

## Blocker Types

| Blocker | Symptoms | Prescription |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Clarity** | Don't know what to do next | Run /hope:intent |
| **Skill Gap** | Know what, don't know how | Find smallest drill |
| **Fear** | Know what, avoiding it | Name fear, smallest scary version |
| **Energy** | Depleted, everything feels hard | Rest first, then smallest action |
| **Audience** | Don't know who to show | Ship to one person today |
| **Accountability** | No one expecting anything | Tell someone your commitment |

## Diagnostic Questions

Answer honestly:

1. **Can I write the next action in one sentence?**
   - No → Clarity blocker

2. **Do I know how to do that action?**
   - No → Skill Gap blocker

3. **Am I avoiding it even though I could start?**
   - Yes → Fear blocker

4. **Would I do it if I had more sleep/food/rest?**
   - Yes → Energy blocker

5. **Would I ship if someone was watching?**
   - Yes → Audience or Accountability blocker

## Prescription Details

### Clarity

```
Symptom: Vague unease, task feels foggy
Root: Intent not crystallized
Fix: Write one sentence describing done state
Tool: /hope:intent
```

### Skill Gap

```
Symptom: Know the goal, don't know the steps
Root: Missing knowledge or practice
Fix: Find the smallest thing you don't know how to do, learn just that
Avoid: Trying to learn everything first
```

### Fear

```
Symptom: Procrastination, busywork, "research"
Root: Avoiding specific outcome (rejection, failure, judgment)
Fix:
  1. Name the fear explicitly
  2. Find smallest version that still scares you
  3. Do that version today
```

### Energy

```
Symptom: Everything feels hard, low motivation
Root: Physical or emotional depletion
Fix:
  1. Stop. Rest is not optional.
  2. After rest: one tiny action to prove you can move
  3. Build momentum slowly
Avoid: Pushing through (it doesn't work)
```

### Audience

```
Symptom: Work feels pointless, no urgency
Root: No one waiting for output
Fix: Identify one real person who could benefit, ship to them today
```

### Accountability

```
Symptom: Deadlines slip, commitments vague
Root: No external expectation
Fix: Tell one person what you'll deliver and when
```

## Resistance Reveals

What you resist doing often reveals the real blocker:

| Resistance Pattern | Likely Blocker |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "I need to research more" | Fear (of starting) |
| "I don't have time" | Clarity (task feels bigger than it is) |
| "It's not ready to share" | Fear (of judgment) |
| "I'll do it tomorrow" | Energy or Fear |
| "I don't know where to start" | Clarity |
| "No one cares anyway" | Audience |

## Quick Unblock

When stuck and no time for deep diagnosis:

1. Set timer for 15 minutes
2. Write down the smallest possible next action
3. Do only that action before timer ends
4. Reassess after

Movement reveals blockers better than analysis.
