# Handshake

Drive action from communication—align understanding, build your case, extract commitment.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Use This Framework |
|---------|-------------------|
| Meetings that need decisions | Prevent vague "agreement" |
| Negotiations or discussions | Verify you're on same page |
| Any conversation requiring follow-up | Extract specific commitments |

## How to Apply

### A - Align Understanding

Before building your case, verify you understand the situation:

```
"Before I continue, let me make sure I understand correctly:
- You're trying to [goal]
- The main constraint is [constraint]
- Success looks like [criteria]

Is that accurate, or am I missing something?"
```

**Wait for confirmation.** Correct any misunderstanding before proceeding.

### B - Build Your Case

Use SCQA to structure your argument:

| Element | Question | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **S**ituation | What's the context? | Establish shared ground |
| **C**omplication | What changed or went wrong? | Create tension |
| **Q**uestion | What decision is needed? | Focus attention |
| **A**nswer | What do you recommend? | Deliver your point |

### C - Commit to Action

Convert agreement into specific commitments:

```
"So we agreed: [decision]

To make this happen:
- [Name] will [specific action] by [date]
- [Name] will [specific action] by [date]

Let's check in on [date] to confirm progress."
```

## Example

**Topic:** Proposing a new testing strategy

```
A - ALIGN
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Let me confirm I understand the situation:
- We're seeing 15% regression rate in production
- The team is spending 30% of time on hotfixes
- You want to ship faster without breaking things

Is that right?"

[Wait for confirmation]

B - BUILD (SCQA)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
S: "We have 15% regression rate and 30% hotfix overhead"
C: "Manual QA can't keep up with our release cadence"
Q: "How do we maintain quality at 2x release speed?"
A: "Implement automated regression suite (3 weeks)"

C - COMMIT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
"So we're proceeding with automated regression.

- Alex will scope the critical paths by Friday
- Jordan will set up the CI pipeline by next Tuesday
- I'll draft the rollout plan for review Thursday

We'll sync next Thursday to confirm we're on track."
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | What Goes Wrong | Prevention |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Skip Align | Build case on wrong foundation | Always verify before arguing |
| Vague commits | "We'll look into it" | Demand name + action + date |
| No checkpoint | Commitments fade | Set explicit follow-up |
| One-sided | Other party doesn't own outcome | Get THEIR commits too |

## Key Insight

Agreement without commitment is just politeness. A handshake isn't real until both parties know exactly what they're doing next.
