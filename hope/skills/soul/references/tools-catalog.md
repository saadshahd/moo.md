## Strategic Frameworks

Higher-level frameworks for complex situations. Use before diving into tactical tools.

| Framework                              | Purpose                             | When to Use                                   |

| [Handshake](handshake.md)              | Drive action from communication     | Meetings, negotiations, getting buy-in        |
| [SCOPE](scope.md)                      | Right-size analysis before starting | Research, investigation, any analysis work    |
| [Leverage Points](leverage-points.md) | Find where to intervene in systems  | Complex system change, choosing interventions |
| [SPOT](spot.md)                        | Surface and act on recurring patterns | Retrospectives, debugging recurring issues  |
