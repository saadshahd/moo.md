# Lindy Effect

The longer something non-perishable has survived, the longer it's likely to continue surviving. Age predicts longevity.

## When to Use

- Library selection: Prefer battle-tested over new
- Technology choices: Consider time-tested options
- Learning: Prioritize knowledge that has lasted
- Architecture: Prefer proven patterns
- Filtering noise from signal

---

## The Framework

### Core Principle

For non-perishable things (ideas, technologies, books):

```
Future life expectancy ∝ Current age
```

A library used for 10 years will likely be used for 10 more.
A library released last month? Unknown.

### What It Applies To

| Lindy Applies | Lindy Doesn't Apply |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Ideas, concepts | Living organisms |
| Technologies | Perishable goods |
| Books, knowledge | Fashions, trends |
| Institutions | Individual careers |
| Proven patterns | Specific implementations |

---

## Application to Software

### Library Selection

| Option | Age | Lindy Prediction |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| React | 10+ years | Likely 10+ more years |
| New framework X | 6 months | Unknown—high risk |
| SQL | 50+ years | Likely 50+ more years |
| NoSQL flavor Y | 3 years | Uncertain |

**Implication**: Default to Lindy-robust choices. Adopt new only with specific justification.

### Knowledge Investment

| Study This | Not This |
|------------|----------|
| Data structures (50+ years) | Framework-specific APIs |
| Algorithms (decades) | This year's tooling |
| TCP/IP, HTTP (decades) | Trendy protocols |
| SQL (50 years) | Query builder du jour |

---

## Why It Works

Time acts as a filter:
- Fragile things break and disappear
- Robust things survive stress testing by reality
- What remains has proven antifragility

> "Things that have survived are hinting to us ex post that they have some robustness."
> — Nassim Taleb

## Lindy-Aligned Decisions

| Decision | Lindy Choice |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C, Python, JavaScript (decades) over new lang |
| Database | PostgreSQL over new distributed thing |
| Patterns | MVC, REST over architectural experiments |
| Principles | SOLID, Unix philosophy over new paradigms |

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Lindy fundamentalism**: New things ARE sometimes better
- **Ignoring context**: Some domains require innovation
- **Survivorship bias**: Survival doesn't guarantee fit for YOUR use case
- **Applying to perishables**: Living things don't follow Lindy

---

## Combination

Pairs with:
- Library-First Protocol: Prefer Lindy-robust libraries
- [Circle of Competence](circle-of-competence.md): Lindy applies more outside your expertise

---

## Provenance

Named after Lindy's Delicatessen in NYC where comedians observed show longevity patterns. Formalized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in *Antifragile* (2012).
