# SBI Feedback Model

Give clear, actionable feedback without judgment.

## When to Use

| Trigger                         | Use This Tool                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Need to give difficult feedback | Structure reduces defensiveness    |
| Feedback received poorly before | Separate observation from judgment |
| Performance conversation        | Be specific, not vague             |

## The Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   S ──────────────▶ B ──────────────▶ I                     │
│                                                             │
│   SITUATION          BEHAVIOR           IMPACT              │
│   When/where?        What specifically? What was the        │
│                      (Observable)       effect?             │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Optional extension: SBI-I (Intent)
"What was your intention?" → Understand before judging
```

## Components

| Component     | Description                           | Example                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Situation** | Specific time and place               | "In yesterday's standup..."                  |
| **Behavior**  | Observable action (no interpretation) | "...you interrupted Alex twice"              |
| **Impact**    | Effect on you, team, or outcome       | "...which made it hard to hear their update" |

## How to Apply

**Giving feedback:**

1. Describe the **situation** (when, where)
2. Describe the **behavior** you observed (facts only)
3. Describe the **impact** (on you, team, or work)
4. Ask for their perspective
5. Discuss desired change

**Receiving feedback:**

1. Listen without defending
2. Ask clarifying questions about S, B, and I
3. Thank them for the feedback
4. Decide what to do with it

## What to Avoid

| Don't Say        | Say Instead                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "You always..."  | "In the last two meetings..."                      |
| "You were rude"  | "You interrupted while I was speaking"             |
| "That was wrong" | "That caused confusion for the team"               |
| "You don't care" | "When you missed the deadline, I felt unsupported" |

## Example

**Situation:** Engineer's PR reviews are too harsh

```
BAD FEEDBACK:
"Your PR reviews are mean and discouraging new team members."

SBI FEEDBACK:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ S: "In the last three PR reviews for junior engineers..."   │
│                                                             │
│ B: "...you used phrases like 'this is wrong' and 'obvious   │
│    mistake' without explaining the alternative."            │
│                                                             │
│ I: "The junior engineers felt discouraged and two told me   │
│    they're now hesitant to submit PRs."                     │
│                                                             │
│ (Ask) "What was your intention with that feedback style?"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**

- Specific situation (last three PRs)
- Observable behavior (actual phrases used)
- Concrete impact (junior engineers' response)
- No judgment of intent
- Opens dialogue

## Key Insight

SBI separates observation from interpretation. "You interrupted" is observable. "You're disrespectful" is interpretation. Stick to observable behavior.
