# Abstraction Laddering

Reframe problems by moving up or down levels of abstraction.

## When to Use

| Trigger                   | Use This Tool           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Stuck on a problem        | Shift abstraction level |
| Solution feels too narrow | Move up the ladder      |
| Problem feels too vague   | Move down the ladder    |

## The Framework

```
    ▲ MORE ABSTRACT (Why?)
    │
    │   "Why do we want this?"
    │             │
    │             ▼
    │   ┌───────────────────┐
    │   │   GOAL LEVEL      │  ← Expand possibility space
    │   │   "What for?"     │
    │   └─────────┬─────────┘
    │             │
    │             ▼
    │   ┌───────────────────┐
    │   │   PROBLEM LEVEL   │  ← Current framing
    │   │   "What problem?" │
    │   └─────────┬─────────┘
    │             │
    │             ▼
    │   ┌───────────────────┐
    │   │   SOLUTION LEVEL  │  ← Constrain to specifics
    │   │   "How to do it?" │
    │   └───────────────────┘
    │
    ▼ MORE CONCRETE (How?)
```

## Movement Questions

| Direction       | Question                   | Purpose                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Up (Why?)**   | "Why do we want this?"     | Open up alternatives    |
| **Down (How?)** | "How specifically?"        | Get actionable          |
| **Lateral**     | "What else achieves this?" | Find parallel solutions |

## How to Apply

1. **State current problem** at middle of ladder
2. **Move up:** Ask "Why?" 2-3 times to find higher goal
3. **Move down:** Ask "How?" 2-3 times to get concrete
4. **Move lateral:** At each level, ask "What else?"
5. **Choose best framing** for your situation

## Example

**Starting point:** "We need a mobile app"

```
    ▲ UP (Why?)
    │
    │   "Why do we need a mobile app?"
    │   → "So customers can check order status on the go"
    │
    │   "Why do they need that?"
    │   → "To reduce anxiety about delivery"
    │
    │   "Why reduce anxiety?"
    │   → "To increase customer satisfaction and retention"
    │
    ├── GOAL: Increase satisfaction and retention
    │
    │   LATERAL: What else increases satisfaction?
    │   → Proactive notifications
    │   → Faster delivery
    │   → Better packaging
    │   → Status page (no app needed)
    │
    │   Original: Mobile app
    │
    │   DOWN (How specifically?):
    │   → Native iOS + Android
    │   → React Native hybrid
    │   → Progressive Web App
    │   → SMS notifications (no app)
    │
    ▼ DOWN (How?)
```

**Insight:** The real goal is reducing anxiety. SMS notifications might achieve this faster and cheaper than a full mobile app.

## Key Insight

Problems reframed at a higher level often have simpler solutions. Moving up expands options; moving down clarifies execution.
