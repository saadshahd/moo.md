# Sunk Cost Fallacy

Don't continue an endeavor solely because of previously invested resources. Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions.

---

## When to Use

- Deciding whether to continue a failing project
- Evaluating technical debt ("but we spent months on this!")
- Career pivots
- Feature cuts
- Relationship/partnership decisions

---

## The Framework

Ask: **"If I were starting fresh today with no history, would I make this choice?"**

| Answer | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Yes | Continue |
| No | Cut losses, regardless of past investment |

### Decision Criteria (Future Only)

| Consider | Ignore |
|----------|--------|
| Future costs | Past costs |
| Future benefits | Past effort |
| Opportunity costs | Emotional attachment |
| Current alternatives | "We've come this far" |

## Example

You've spent 6 months building a feature. It's 80% done but user research shows no one wants it.

| Sunk Cost Thinking | Rational Thinking |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "We can't waste 6 months of work" | "Would I start this feature today?" |
| Ship it anyway | No → Stop immediately |

**The 6 months are gone either way.** The question is: what's the best use of the NEXT 2 months?

---

## Why We Fall For It

- **Loss aversion**: Losing hurts 2x more than winning feels good
- **Ego protection**: Admitting failure is painful
- **Public commitment**: We told others we'd finish

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Premature quitting**: Not everything that's hard is a sunk cost trap
- **Ignoring learning value**: Sometimes the investment taught you something valuable
- **Binary thinking**: Can you pivot rather than abandon entirely?

## Provenance

Behavioral economics research. Also called "Concorde Fallacy" after British/French governments continued funding the supersonic jet despite clear financial failure.
