# Hard Choice Model

Navigate decisions where no option is clearly better.

## When to Use

| Trigger                           | Use This Tool                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Decision matrix shows tie         | Options are "on par"          |
| Gut says one thing, logic another | Values conflict               |
| "I could go either way"           | Need to commit without regret |

## The Framework

```
                    EASY CHOICE
                 (one dominates)
                        │
    ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
    │                   │                   │
    ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌─────────┐       ┌───────────┐       ┌─────────┐
│ BETTER  │       │  ON PAR   │       │  WORSE  │
│         │       │           │       │         │
│ A > B   │       │  A ~ B    │       │ A < B   │
│ clearly │       │  neither  │       │ clearly │
└─────────┘       │  dominates│       └─────────┘
                  └─────┬─────┘
                        │
                   HARD CHOICE
                        │
                        ▼
                ┌─────────────────┐
                │ Create reasons  │
                │ (don't find)    │
                └─────────────────┘
```

## The Key Insight

Hard choices aren't hard because you lack information. They're hard because:

- Options are **on par** (neither better nor worse overall)
- The decision reveals **who you want to be**
- You must **create** reasons, not discover them

## How to Apply

1. **Confirm it's a hard choice**

   - Is one option clearly better? → Easy choice, just pick it
   - Are options on par? → Hard choice, continue

2. **Ask identity questions**

   - "What kind of [person/company/team] do I want to be?"
   - "Which option aligns with my values?"
   - "In 10 years, which path will I be proud of?"

3. **Create your reason**

   - Don't wait for external validation
   - Commit because this is who you choose to be
   - Own the decision fully

4. **Eliminate regret framing**
   - Both options are valid (that's why it's hard)
   - Regret comes from not committing, not from the choice itself

## Example

**Decision:** Stay at stable job vs. join risky startup

```
Analysis:
┌────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
│ Factor         │ Stay      │ Join      │
├────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┤
│ Income (5yr)   │ Higher    │ Lower     │
│ Learning       │ Lower     │ Higher    │
│ Risk           │ Lower     │ Higher    │
│ Excitement     │ Lower     │ Higher    │
│ Security       │ Higher    │ Lower     │
└────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┘

Verdict: ON PAR (neither dominates)

Identity question:
"What kind of professional do I want to be?"

Option A (Stay): "I value stability and depth"
Option B (Join): "I value growth and adventure"

Neither answer is wrong. The choice reveals your values.
```

**Wrong approach:** More analysis (won't help—options are on par)
**Right approach:** Decide who you want to be, then commit fully
