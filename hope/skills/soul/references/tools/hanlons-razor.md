# Hanlon's Razor

Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence, ignorance, or neglect.

---

## When to Use

- Receiving critical feedback
- Code review comments that seem harsh
- Debugging others' code ("why would they do this?")
- Interpersonal conflict
- Customer complaints

---

## The Framework

Before assuming bad intent, ask:

1. **Mistake?** Could this be an honest error?
2. **Ignorance?** Could they lack context I have?
3. **Time pressure?** Were they rushed?
4. **Different priorities?** Do they optimize for something else?
5. **Only then**: Consider malice (rarely the answer)

## Example

Colleague's code broke your feature.

| Assumption | Response |
|------------|----------|
| "They sabotaged me" | Defensive, accusatory |
| "They didn't know about my dependency" | Collaborative, fix-forward |

**The second interpretation is almost always correct** and leads to better outcomes.

## Key Insight

Data shows most workplace errors come from oversight, not malicious intent. Companies reduce disputes by 55% when leaders ask "What went wrong?" instead of "Who messed up?"

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Ignoring repeated patterns**: If someone consistently causes harm, don't ignore it
- **Excusing genuine misconduct**: Razor is a starting assumption, not a conclusion
- **Self-application failure**: Apply to others AND yourself

---

## Provenance

Named after Robert J. Hanlon (1980). Earlier versions from Robert Heinlein (1941) and Napoleon: "Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
