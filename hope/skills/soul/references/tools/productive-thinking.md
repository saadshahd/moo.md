# Productive Thinking Model

Solve problems creatively through six structured steps.

## When to Use

| Trigger                                | Use This Tool                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Complex problem needing fresh approach | Full creative process         |
| Team brainstorm session                | Structured facilitation       |
| Innovation challenge                   | Move beyond obvious solutions |

## The Six Steps

| Step                        | Purpose             | Key Questions                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. What's Going On?**     | Understand context  | What's the itch? Who cares? What's been tried?        |
| **2. What's Success?**      | Define target       | What does "solved" look like? How do we measure?      |
| **3. What's the Question?** | Frame the problem   | What's the real question? (often not the obvious one) |
| **4. Generate Answers**     | Divergent thinking  | How many ideas can we generate? (aim for 100+)        |
| **5. Forge the Solution**   | Convergent thinking | Which ideas combine well? What's missing?             |
| **6. Align Resources**      | Plan execution      | What's the first step? Who's accountable?             |

## How to Apply

**Steps 1-3:** Problem exploration (diverge then converge)
**Step 4:** Idea generation (diverge only)
**Steps 5-6:** Solution building (converge)

Time allocation (2-hour session):

- Steps 1-3: 30 min
- Step 4: 40 min
- Step 5: 30 min
- Step 6: 20 min

## Example

**Challenge:** Reduce customer support ticket volume

```
1. WHAT'S GOING ON?
   - 500 tickets/day, team of 4
   - 60% are "how do I...?" questions
   - Docs exist but users don't find them
   - Support team burning out

2. WHAT'S SUCCESS?
   - Reduce tickets to 200/day
   - Response time < 4 hours
   - Team satisfaction improves
   - Measured over 90 days

3. WHAT'S THE QUESTION?
   First framing: "How do we answer tickets faster?"
   Better framing: "How do we help users help themselves?"
   Best framing: "How do we make common tasks obvious?"

4. GENERATE ANSWERS (sample of 50+)
   - In-app contextual help
   - Video walkthroughs
   - Chatbot for FAQs
   - Redesign confusing UI
   - Onboarding overhaul
   - Community forum
   - Power user program
   ...

5. FORGE THE SOLUTION
   Combine: In-app help + UI redesign for top 5 ticket causes
   Strengthen: Add analytics to know what help is viewed

6. ALIGN RESOURCES
   Week 1-2: Analyze top 5 ticket causes
   Week 3-4: Build in-app help for #1 cause
   Week 5-6: Test and iterate
   Owner: Product team, supported by support
```
