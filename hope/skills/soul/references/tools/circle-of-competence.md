# Circle of Competence

Know the boundaries of your expertise. Stay within them, or acknowledge when you're outside.

---

## When to Use

- Before taking on unfamiliar work
- Investment/resource allocation decisions
- Hiring decisions (what expertise do you need?)
- Choosing what NOT to do
- Confidence calibration

---

## The Framework

### 1. Define Your Circle

What do you truly understand deeply?

| Inside Circle | Outside Circle |
|---------------|----------------|
| Can explain to a child | Only surface familiarity |
| Know the edge cases | Know the buzzwords |
| Understand the failures | Only seen successes |
| Years of deliberate practice | Casual exposure |

### 2. Know the Edge

Where does real knowledge end and guessing begin?

**Test**: Can you predict second-order effects? Can you identify when experts are wrong?

### 3. Operate Accordingly

| Position | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Inside circle | Move confidently, take calculated risks |
| Edge of circle | Proceed carefully, seek validation |
| Outside circle | Defer to experts, learn before acting |

## Key Insight

> "The size of your circle is not important; knowing its boundaries is vital."
> — Warren Buffett

Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) had a tiny circle—furniture retail—but knew it perfectly. She wouldn't touch stocks "even at 50 cents a share" because they were outside her circle.

## Expanding Your Circle

Circles can grow, but only through:
- Deliberate practice (not passive consumption)
- Feedback loops (learn from mistakes)
- Time (no shortcuts)

**Warning**: As you cross from inside to outside, confidence doesn't drop as fast as competence. This is the danger zone.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **False humility**: Claiming ignorance in areas you actually know
- **Expert creep**: Assuming expertise in one area transfers to another
- **Static circles**: Believing your competence is fixed

---

## Combination

Pairs well with:
- [Confidence Gates](../../../SKILL.md): Match confidence to circle position
- [Sunk Cost](sunk-cost.md): Don't persist in areas outside your circle just because you started

---

## Provenance

Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger. Buffett's 1996 shareholder letter formalized the concept. Andrew Carnegie earlier advised investing only in what you understand.
