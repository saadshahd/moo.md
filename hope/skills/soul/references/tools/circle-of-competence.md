# Circle of Competence

Know the boundaries of your expertise. Stay within them, or acknowledge when you're outside.

---

## When to Use

- Before taking on unfamiliar work
- Investment/resource allocation decisions
- Hiring decisions (what expertise do you need?)
- Choosing what NOT to do
- Confidence calibration

---

## The Framework

### 1. Define Your Circle

What do you truly understand deeply?

| Inside Circle                | Outside Circle           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Can explain to a child       | Only surface familiarity |
| Know the edge cases          | Know the buzzwords       |
| Understand the failures      | Only seen successes      |
| Years of deliberate practice | Casual exposure          |

### 2. Know the Edge

Where does real knowledge end and guessing begin?

**Test**: Can you predict second-order effects? Can you identify when experts are wrong?

### 3. Operate Accordingly

| Position       | Action                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Inside circle  | Move confidently, take calculated risks |
| Edge of circle | Proceed carefully, seek validation      |
| Outside circle | Defer to experts, learn before acting   |

## Key Insight

> "The size of your circle is not important; knowing its boundaries is vital."
> — Warren Buffett

Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin) had a tiny circle—furniture retail—but knew it perfectly. She wouldn't touch stocks "even at 50 cents a share" because they were outside her circle.

## Expanding Your Circle

Circles can grow, but only through:

- Deliberate practice (not passive consumption)
- Feedback loops (learn from mistakes)
- Time (no shortcuts)

**Warning**: As you cross from inside to outside, confidence doesn't drop as fast as competence. This is the danger zone.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **False humility**: Claiming ignorance in areas you actually know
- **Expert creep**: Assuming expertise in one area transfers to another
- **Static circles**: Believing your competence is fixed

## Evaluating Others' Expertise

Not all claimed experts are genuine. Use these probes:

**Signs of real expertise:**

| Behavior                                  | Why It Matters          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Admits "I don't know" readily             | Confident in boundaries |
| Explains concepts multiple ways           | Deep understanding      |
| Discusses failures openly                 | Learned from experience |
| Gives specific, context-dependent answers | Not regurgitating rules |
| Says "it depends on..."                   | Understands nuance      |

**Signs of imitation:**

| Behavior                        | Why It's a Warning        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Never admits uncertainty        | Hiding limits             |
| Only one explanation style      | Memorized, not understood |
| Only shares successes           | No failure-based learning |
| Gives confident universal rules | Ignoring context          |
| Dismisses edge cases            | Surface knowledge         |

**Key distinction:**

> "Specific knowledge is earned, not learned."
> — Naval Ravikant

**Popularizer vs Expert:**

- Popularizers communicate well (valuable!)
- But communication skill ≠ deep expertise
- Seek the source, not the translator, for critical decisions

**Probe questions:**

1. "When does this approach NOT work?"
2. "What's a mistake you made learning this?"
3. "How would you explain this to [different audience]?"
4. "What would change your recommendation?"

## Combination

Pairs well with:

- [Confidence Gates](../../../SKILL.md): Match confidence to circle position
- [Sunk Cost](sunk-cost.md): Don't persist in areas outside your circle just because you started

## Provenance

Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger. Buffett's 1996 shareholder letter formalized the concept. Andrew Carnegie earlier advised investing only in what you understand.
