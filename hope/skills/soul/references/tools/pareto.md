# Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Focus on the vital few, not the trivial many.

## When to Use

- Prioritization: Which tasks matter most?
- Debugging: Which 20% of code causes 80% of bugs?
- Time management: Which activities drive results?
- Customer focus: Which customers generate most value?
- Feature planning: Which features deliver most impact?

## The Framework

1. **List** all activities, causes, or inputs
2. **Measure** their impact/output
3. **Rank** by impact (descending)
4. **Identify** the vital 20% (may be 10% or 30%)
5. **Focus** resources disproportionately there

### Example

| Activity | Time Spent | Results |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Deep work on core feature | 20% | 80% of value |
| Meetings, email, admin | 80% | 20% of value |

**Implication**: Protect and expand deep work time ruthlessly.

## Applications

| Domain | 80/20 Pattern |
|--------|---------------|
| Software | 20% of bugs cause 80% of crashes (Microsoft data) |
| Business | 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue |
| Productivity | 20% of tasks produce 80% of outcomes |
| Learning | 20% of concepts unlock 80% of understanding |

## Caveats

- **Ratio varies**: Could be 90/10, 70/30, or 99/1
- **Numbers don't add to 100**: 20% of causes, 80% of effects are independent measures
- **Critical minorities matter**: 80% of a bridge is useless; you need 100%
- **Not an excuse to ignore**: The remaining 80% may contain critical items

---

## Combination

Pairs well with:
- [Eisenhower Matrix](eisenhower.md): Urgent/Important + 80/20
- [Impact-Effort](impact-effort.md): Find high-impact, low-effort items
- Timeboxing: Allocate time based on Pareto analysis

## Provenance

Vilfredo Pareto (1896) observed 80% of Italian land owned by 20% of population. Joseph Juran (1940s) applied to quality management: "the vital few and the useful many."
