# Ladder of Inference

Avoid jumping to conclusions. Make decisions based on reality.

## When to Use

| Trigger                      | Use This Tool                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Strong emotional reaction    | Check if assumptions drove it       |
| Disagreement with others     | Find where interpretations diverged |
| Confident but might be wrong | Trace reasoning back to data        |

## The Framework

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │    7. ACTIONS               │  ◀── I act based on beliefs
    │       "I do X"              │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    6. BELIEFS               │  ◀── I form beliefs
    │       "This is true"        │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    5. CONCLUSIONS           │  ◀── I draw conclusions
    │       "Therefore..."        │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    4. ASSUMPTIONS           │  ◀── I make assumptions
    │       "This means..."       │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    3. MEANINGS              │  ◀── I add meaning
    │       "I interpret as..."   │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    2. SELECTED DATA         │  ◀── I select what I notice
    │       "I focus on..."       │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │    1. OBSERVABLE DATA       │  ◀── Raw reality
    │       "What actually        │
    │        happened"            │
    └─────────────────────────────┘

    ▲ We climb instantly (milliseconds)
    ▼ We must consciously climb down
```

## How to Apply

**Climbing Down (when you catch yourself reacting):**

1. What action am I about to take?
2. What belief is driving this action?
3. What conclusion led to that belief?
4. What assumptions did I make?
5. What meaning did I add to the data?
6. What data did I select (and ignore)?
7. What actually happened (observable facts only)?

**Checking Others:**

Ask: "Help me understand—what are you seeing that led you to that conclusion?"

## Example

**Situation:** Team member didn't respond to your Slack message for 3 hours

```
Your ladder climb (automatic):
───────────────────────────────────────────
7. ACTION: I'll escalate to their manager
6. BELIEF: They don't respect me
5. CONCLUSION: They're ignoring me deliberately
4. ASSUMPTION: They saw my message
3. MEANING: No response = disrespect
2. SELECTED: The 3-hour gap (ignored their calendar)
1. DATA: Message sent at 10am, no reply by 1pm
───────────────────────────────────────────

Climbing back down:
───────────────────────────────────────────
1. DATA: Message sent at 10am, no reply by 1pm
   CHECK: What else is true?
   - Their calendar shows 10am-1pm: "Focus time"
   - They usually respond within 30 min
   - No pattern of ignoring me before

2. ALTERNATIVE MEANING: They're in deep work
3. ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTION: They haven't seen it yet
4. BETTER CONCLUSION: Wait or try different channel
5. BETTER BELIEF: They're busy, not disrespectful
6. BETTER ACTION: Wait until 2pm, then ping again
───────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Key insight:** The jump from data to meaning is where we usually go wrong.
