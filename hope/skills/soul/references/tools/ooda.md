# OODA Loop

Make faster decisions with incomplete information.

## When to Use

| Trigger                    | Use This Tool                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Competitive pressure       | Outpace opponent's decision cycle            |
| Rapidly changing situation | Adapt faster than conditions change          |
| Time-critical decisions    | When "good enough now" beats "perfect later" |

## The Framework

```
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                              │
    │    ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐            │
    │    │ OBSERVE │───────▶│  ORIENT │            │
    │    └─────────┘        └────┬────┘            │
    │         ▲                  │                 │
    │         │                  │                 │
    │         │                  ▼                 │
    │    ┌─────────┐        ┌─────────┐            │
    │    │   ACT   │◀───────│ DECIDE  │            │
    │    └─────────┘        └─────────┘            │
    │                                              │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              Speed through loop > perfection at any step
```

## Phases

| Phase       | Action                                   | Output               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Observe** | Gather raw data, signals, feedback       | Situation awareness  |
| **Orient**  | Analyze, synthesize, update mental model | Decision framework   |
| **Decide**  | Select action from options               | Commitment to course |
| **Act**     | Execute, generate new data for next loop | Feedback             |

## How to Apply

1. **Observe**: What do I know right now? (not what I assume)
2. **Orient**: What does this mean? What's changed from before?
3. **Decide**: What's the best action given current info?
4. **Act**: Execute quickly, then observe the results
5. **Repeat**: Use outcomes to inform next observation

## Key Insight

The goal isn't perfect decisions—it's faster loops. If you cycle through OODA faster than the situation changes, you stay ahead.

```
Your OODA loop:  O → O → D → A → O → O → D → A → ...
Situation:       ─────────────changes──────────────
                              ▲
                     You adapt before this
```

## Example

**Situation:** Competitor launched similar feature yesterday

```
OBSERVE:
- Their feature has X, Y, Z capabilities
- Twitter sentiment: 60% positive, 40% "meh"
- Our users asking about it in Slack

ORIENT:
- They beat us to market but feature is incomplete
- Their Z capability is weak (our strength)
- Our users care most about Z

DECIDE:
- Fast-follow with Z-focused messaging
- Don't try to match X, Y (they're ahead)
- Ship our Z improvement this week

ACT:
- Deploy Z enhancement (already 80% done)
- Push "we do Z better" positioning
- → Observe response, loop again
```

**Wrong approach:** 2-week competitive analysis (too slow)
**Right approach:** Ship and observe within 48 hours
