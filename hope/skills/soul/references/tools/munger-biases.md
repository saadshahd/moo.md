# Munger's 25 Cognitive Biases

A checklist of psychological tendencies that cause human misjudgment. Run before high-stakes decisions.

## When to Use

- Before major decisions (investments, architecture, hiring)
- When confidence is high (overconfidence check)
- Post-mortem analysis (which biases contributed?)
- When something feels "obviously right" (danger signal)

## The 25 Tendencies

### Incentive Biases

| #   | Tendency                             | Description                                                                               | Check                                         |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Reward/Punishment Super-Response** | Incentives drive behavior more than we admit. "Never ask a barber if you need a haircut." | What incentives are at play? Who benefits?    |
| 2   | **Reciprocation**                    | We feel obligated to return favors, even unwanted ones. Exploited by salespeople.         | Am I deciding based on obligation, not merit? |

### Emotional Biases

| #   | Tendency             | Description                                                                              | Check                                             |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 3   | **Liking/Loving**    | We distort facts to favor people we like. We believe people we like.                     | Would I judge this differently from a stranger?   |
| 4   | **Disliking/Hating** | We distort facts against people we dislike. We ignore good ideas from enemies.           | Am I dismissing this because of WHO said it?      |
| 5   | **Envy/Jealousy**    | Comparisons drive irrational behavior. "It's not greed that drives the world, but envy." | Am I reacting to what they have, not what I need? |

### Certainty Biases

| #   | Tendency                    | Description                                                                                  | Check                                               |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 6   | **Doubt-Avoidance**         | We rush decisions to escape uncomfortable uncertainty. Quick closure feels better.           | Am I deciding too fast to escape discomfort?        |
| 7   | **Inconsistency-Avoidance** | We resist changing beliefs once formed. Sunk identities.                                     | What would change my mind? Have I considered it?    |
| 8   | **Excessive Self-Regard**   | We overrate ourselves, our projects, our decisions. 90% think they're above-average drivers. | Would I rate this as highly if someone else did it? |
| 9   | **Over-Optimism**           | We systematically underestimate risks and timelines. Planning fallacy.                       | What's the base rate for projects like this?        |

### Loss & Pain Biases

| #   | Tendency                    | Description                                                                                | Check                                 |
| --- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 10  | **Deprival Super-Reaction** | Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains feel good. We fight harder to keep than to gain. | Am I overweighting what I might lose? |
| 11  | **Pain-Avoiding Denial**    | We deny reality to avoid psychological pain. "This can't be happening."                    | What reality am I refusing to see?    |

### Social Biases

| #   | Tendency                   | Description                                                                     | Check                                         |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 12  | **Social Proof**           | We follow the crowd, especially under uncertainty. "Everyone else is doing it." | Would I do this if no one else was?           |
| 13  | **Authority-Misinfluence** | We defer excessively to authority figures. Milgram experiments.                 | Is this right, or just endorsed by authority? |
| 14  | **Kantian Fairness**       | We expect reciprocal fairness and resent violations intensely.                  | Am I overreacting to perceived unfairness?    |

### Perception Biases

| #   | Tendency                       | Description                                                                                  | Check                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 15  | **Contrast-Misreaction**       | We judge relative to nearby things, not absolute value. $100 seems cheap after seeing $1000. | Am I comparing to the right baseline?       |
| 16  | **Availability-Misweighing**   | We overweight what's easily recalled. Recent/vivid events dominate.                          | Is this actually common, or just memorable? |
| 17  | **Influence-from-Association** | We conflate messengers with messages. Kill the bearer of bad news.                           | Am I judging the idea or its source?        |

### Cognitive Biases

| #   | Tendency              | Description                                                           | Check                                             |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 18  | **Reason-Respecting** | We comply more when given reasons, even bad ones. "Because" is magic. | Is this actually a good reason, or just A reason? |
| 19  | **Twaddle**           | We talk confidently about things we don't understand. Fake expertise. | Do I actually understand this, or am I faking?    |
| 20  | **Use-It-or-Lose-It** | Skills atrophy without practice. Knowledge decays.                    | When did I last actually practice this?           |

### Stress & State Biases

| #   | Tendency                    | Description                                                      | Check                                         |
| --- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 21  | **Stress-Influence**        | Stress amplifies all other biases. Tunnel vision under pressure. | Am I stressed? Should I delay this decision?  |
| 22  | **Drug-Misinfluence**       | Chemicals alter judgment (caffeine, alcohol, lack of sleep).     | Is my physiological state affecting judgment? |
| 23  | **Senescence-Misinfluence** | Age-related cognitive changes we don't notice.                   | Am I relying on outdated mental models?       |

### Positive Tendency

| #   | Tendency      | Description                          | Note                         |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 24  | **Curiosity** | We're drawn to learn and understand. | Leverage this. Stay curious. |

### The Meta-Bias

| #   | Tendency                | Description                                                                       | Check                                                   |
| --- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 25  | **Lollapalooza Effect** | Multiple biases combine for extreme, irrational outcomes. Bubbles, cults, panics. | Are several biases pointing the same direction? DANGER. |

## Quick Pre-Decision Checklist

Before high-confidence decisions, scan for:

```
□ Incentives: Who benefits from this decision?
□ Emotions: Am I too attached/opposed to someone involved?
□ Certainty: Am I rushing to avoid discomfort?
□ Self-regard: Would I rate this highly if someone else did it?
□ Loss: Am I overweighting what I might lose?
□ Social: Am I following the crowd or authority blindly?
□ Availability: Is this vivid/recent, or actually common?
□ Stress: Am I in a good state to decide?
□ Lollapalooza: Are multiple biases aligned? (Red flag)
```

## Munger's Advice

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."

Use inversion: Instead of asking "How do I decide well?", ask "How would I decide badly?" Then don't do that.
