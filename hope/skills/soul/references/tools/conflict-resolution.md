# Conflict Resolution Diagram (Evaporating Cloud)

Find win-win solutions by surfacing hidden assumptions.

## When to Use

| Trigger                         | Use This Tool         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Two positions seem incompatible | Find underlying needs |
| Negotiation at impasse          | Break false dichotomy |
| Team disagreement               | Align on shared goal  |

## The Framework

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   SHARED GOAL   │
                    │   (Both want)   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
              ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
              │                             │
              ▼                             ▼
        ┌───────────┐                 ┌───────────┐
        │ Need A    │                 │ Need B    │
        │ (Party 1) │                 │ (Party 2) │
        └─────┬─────┘                 └─────┬─────┘
              │                             │
              ▼                             ▼
        ┌───────────┐    CONFLICT    ┌───────────┐
        │ Want A    │◀─────────────▶ │ Want B    │
        │ (Position)│                │ (Position)│
        └───────────┘                └───────────┘

Assumption surfacing: "For Need A, I must have Want A because..."
Challenge assumptions to "evaporate" the conflict.
```

## Components

| Element         | Description                              | Question to Ask                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Goal** | What both parties ultimately want        | "What do we both care about?"           |
| **Need A/B**    | Underlying requirement (not position)    | "What need does this position serve?"   |
| **Want A/B**    | Specific position or solution            | "What specifically are you asking for?" |
| **Assumptions** | Why the need requires that specific want | "Why must it be done that way?"         |

## How to Apply

1. **Identify the conflict:** What are the opposing positions?
2. **Find the shared goal:** What do both parties ultimately want?
3. **Surface needs:** What underlying need does each position serve?
4. **Identify assumptions:** Why does each need require that specific want?
5. **Challenge assumptions:** Which assumptions can be broken?
6. **Find win-win:** What solution satisfies both needs without the conflict?

## Example

**Conflict:** Engineering wants more time; Product wants faster shipping

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │     SHARED GOAL         │
                    │  Successful product     │
                    │  that users love        │
                    └───────────┬─────────────┘
                                │
              ┌─────────────────┴─────────────────┐
              │                                   │
              ▼                                   ▼
        ┌───────────────┐                 ┌───────────────┐
        │ Need:         │                 │ Need:         │
        │ Quality code  │                 │ Market timing │
        │ Low tech debt │                 │ User feedback │
        └───────┬───────┘                 └───────┬───────┘
                │                                 │
                ▼                                 ▼
        ┌───────────────┐      ⚡        ┌───────────────┐
        │ Want:         │◀────────────▶ │ Want:         │
        │ 6-week sprint │               │ 2-week sprint │
        └───────────────┘               └───────────────┘

ASSUMPTIONS TO CHALLENGE:
├── "Quality requires 6 weeks" → Can we scope smaller?
├── "Feedback requires full feature" → Can we test with prototype?
└── "Tech debt is all or nothing" → Can we timebox debt work?

WIN-WIN SOLUTION:
2-week sprints with:
- Smaller scoped features (not full vision)
- 20% time allocated to debt
- Prototype testing before full build
```

## Key Insight

Most conflicts are between **positions**, not **needs**. When you surface the underlying needs and challenge assumptions connecting needs to positions, the conflict often "evaporates."
