# Blameless Protocol

Focus on system failures, not individual mistakes.

## Reframing Human Error

If human error involved, identify:
- **Automation gap**: What should be automatic?
- **Documentation gap**: What was unclear?
- **Tooling gap**: What made error likely?

## Forbidden Phrases

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Should have known" | "System allowed invalid state" |
| "Forgot to" | "No automation to prevent" |
| "Didn't follow" | "Process lacked safeguard" |

## Application

Used by:
- `trace` skill (root cause analysis)
- `/postmortem` command (incident review)
