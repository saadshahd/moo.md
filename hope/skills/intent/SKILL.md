description: Turn rough ideas into iron-clad work orders through 6-step clarification protocol before building. Use when request is vague like "add a button", "make it better", "fix the thing". Produces spec score and workflow shape.

# Intent Translator

## Mission

Turn rough ideas into iron-clad work orders, then deliver the work only after both parties agree it's right.

---

## Protocol

### 0 Task Definition Protocol

Fill every field before proceeding:

```
TASK (verb + object + outcome):
CONTEXT (where it lives, who uses it, connections):
DONE LOOKS LIKE (artifact you can point to):
STAKES IF WRONG: low / medium / high — Why:
WHO REVIEWS: Before shipping: / After shipping:
```

If any field blank after 2 asks: proceed with [ASSUMPTION] labels.

### 0b Silent Scan

Privately list every fact or constraint you still need.

### 0c Action Specification (Loop 1)

Transform vague requests into actionable specs.

#### Vague → Specific Transformation

| Vague (Loop 2) | Specific (Loop 1) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Improve performance" | "Reduce p95 latency from 200ms to <100ms" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Null check on line 42 of auth.ts" |
| "Make it better" | "Add input validation for email field" |
| "Update the docs" | "Add API examples to README section 3" |

#### Action Spec Template

For every task, fill in:

```
VERB: [Create/Update/Delete/Fix/Add/Remove]
OBJECT: [Specific file, function, or component]
OUTCOME: [Measurable end state]
CONSTRAINT: [What NOT to change]
VERIFY: [How to confirm done]
```

#### Loop 2 Warning Signs

You're in reactive mode if:
- Waiting for someone to clarify
- "I don't know what they want"
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Success criteria is "they'll tell me"

#### Loop 1 Recovery

When stuck in Loop 2:
1. Write down your best guess at the spec
2. List your assumptions explicitly
3. Ask ONE clarifying question
4. Propose a specific solution

Don't wait. Propose and iterate.

### 1 Clarify Loop

Use the Ask tool until you estimate ≥ 95% confidence you can ship the correct result.

Cover:

- Purpose
- Audience
- Must-include facts
- Success criteria
- Length/format
- Tech stack (if code)
- Edge cases
- Risk tolerances

### 2 Spec Score Check

After clarifying, score the request:

| Dimension | Score | Gap |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Outcome | /2 | |
| Scope | /2 | |
| Constraints | /2 | |
| Success Criteria | /2 | |
| Done Definition | /2 | |
| **Total** | /10 | |

- **≥8:** Proceed to build (Tool-shaped)
- **5-7:** Iterate together (Colleague-shaped) OR clarify more
- **<5:** Continue clarification loop

### 3 Echo Check

Reply with one crisp sentence stating: **deliverable + #1 must-include fact + hardest constraint.**

End with:

- YES to lock
- EDITS
- BLUEPRINT
- RISK… WAIT

### 4 Blueprint (if asked)

Produce a short plan:

- Key steps
- Interface or outline
- Sample I/O or section headers

Pause for: YES / EDITS / RISK

### 5 Risk (if asked)

List the top three failure scenarios (logic, legal, security, perf).

Pause for: YES / EDITS

### 6 High-Grade Intent (score ≥8 only)

For well-specified requests, produce:

```
OBJECTIVE:

NON-GOALS (3-5 bullets):
-
-
-

CONSTRAINTS:

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (7-12 bullets, 2+ "must NOT"):
-
-
- must NOT:
- must NOT:

STOP CONDITIONS (3-5 bullets):
-
-
-
```

### 7 Build & Self-Test

Generate code / copy / analysis only after **YES–GO**.

**If code:**

- Run static self-review for type errors & obvious perf hits
- Fix anything you find, then deliver

**If prose:**

- Check tone & fact alignment
- Fix anything you find, then deliver

### 8 Reset

If user types **RESET**, forget everything and restart at Step 0.
