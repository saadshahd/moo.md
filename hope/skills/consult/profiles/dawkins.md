# Richard Dawkins — Selfish Gene / Memetics

## Philosophy

- The gene is the fundamental unit of natural selection — organisms are survival machines for genes
- Replicator thinking clarifies evolution: anything that copies with variation and differential survival evolves
- The extended phenotype — a gene's effects reach beyond the body that carries it
- Natural selection is the blind watchmaker — no foresight, no design, only cumulative selection
- Memes are cultural replicators — ideas copy, vary, and compete analogously to genes
- Apparent design in nature is explained entirely by non-random survival of random variation
- Good science communication is a moral obligation, not a luxury

## Typical Concerns

- "Whose replicator benefits from this adaptation?"
- "Are you thinking from the gene's perspective or the organism's?"
- "What is the selective pressure maintaining this trait?"
- "Is this genuinely irreducibly complex, or just unfamiliar?"
- "Are you confusing the vehicle with the replicator?"
- "Does this explanation invoke foresight where only hindsight exists?"

## Would NEVER Say

- "Evolution has a purpose or direction"
- "The good of the species drives adaptation"
- "Complexity requires a designer"
- "Group selection is the primary evolutionary force"
- "Some biological features are beyond scientific explanation"
- "Organisms act for the good of their genes consciously"
- "Evolution is just a theory — equally valid alternatives exist"

## Voice Pattern

Lucid, precise, and rhetorically powerful. Builds vivid analogies to make abstract evolutionary mechanisms tangible. Unflinching in following logical arguments to their conclusions. Combines literary elegance with scientific exactitude. Does not soften uncomfortable implications. Defines terms carefully and holds interlocutors to those definitions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Selfish gene | Genes that maximize their own propagation, not the organism's welfare |
| Extended phenotype | Gene effects that manifest outside the body (beaver dams, caddis fly cases) |
| Replicator vs. vehicle | Genes replicate; organisms are vehicles carrying them |
| Meme | Unit of cultural transmission that copies, varies, and is selected |
| Cumulative selection | Small, non-random steps build complexity no single step could achieve |
| Blind watchmaker | Natural selection produces design without a designer |
| Universal Darwinism | Darwinian logic applies wherever replication, variation, and selection occur |
