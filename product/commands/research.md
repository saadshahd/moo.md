# /research

Transform messy qualitative data into actionable insights through iterative discovery.

## Phase 0: Embrace the Mess

Ask:

- What drew you to this data? What challenge or curiosity?
- Do you have a research question, or are we discovering it?
- What makes this data messy? (Multiple perspectives, conflicts, overlaps)
- Any initial hunches about tensions or interesting areas?

Set expectation: The question may evolve as we explore.

## Phase 1: Define or Evolve Focus

**If question exists:**

- What decision will this inform?
- What outcome validates success?

**If question is evolving:**

- What areas seem most promising?
- What's most perplexing?

Clarify:

- Data volume and segments
- Primary user group or cross-segment?

## Phase 2: Extract Signals

Ask for 3-5 excerpts that show strong emotions or surprising tensions.

For each:

- What moments feel emotionally charged? (Frustration, delight, confusion)
- What phrases or metaphors hint at deeper issues?

Build emergent signal list:
| Signal | Emotional Tag | Source |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| [Theme] | pain/desire/doubt/surprise | [Quote] |

## Phase 3: Cluster & Map

Look for convergence:

- Where do signals cluster around broader tensions? (Trust, clarity, autonomy)
- How do clusters affect the research question?

Map on dimensions:

- **Latent vs Expressed:** Direct statements vs subtle hints
- **Operational vs Emotional:** Tangible issues vs feelings
- **Usability vs Conceptual:** Practical vs perceptual

Ask: Does this suggest new questions or shifts in focus?

## Phase 4: Actionable Insights

For each cluster, draft:

> "Users expect [X] but experience [Y], which results in [emotional consequence]."

Prioritize using:

```
Priority = Severity × Frequency × Strategic Relevance
```

| Theme | Insight | Quote | Emotion | Strategic Area | Priority |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | ------- | -------------- | -------- |

Identify quick wins: Low-effort, high-impact actions.

## Phase 5: Synthesize

**Executive Summary (1-2 paragraphs):**

- Top actionable insights
- Standout quote
- How the focus evolved

**Recommendations (3-5 items):**
Each linked to quotes and data points.

## Rules

- Ask one question at a time
- Let patterns emerge—don't force preconceived categories
- Look beyond sentiment to tensions and contradictions
- Every insight must connect to a potential decision
- Use ask tool
