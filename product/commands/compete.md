# /compete

Analyze competitive landscape and generate strategic recommendations.

## Input Required

Ask for:

- Competitor data (feature lists, pricing, reviews, analyst reports)
- Your product context (name, capabilities, target market, position)
- Win/loss data if available

## Phase 1: Landscape Overview

For each primary competitor (3-5):

```
### [Competitor Name]
- Position: [Leader/Challenger/Niche]
- Strengths: [2-3 key advantages]
- Weaknesses: [2-3 vulnerabilities]
- Recent Moves: [New features, pricing changes, acquisitions]
```

Note emerging threats (new entrants, adjacent players).

## Phase 2: Feature Comparison Matrix

| Category | Your Product | Comp A   | Comp B   | Comp C   | Market Expectation  |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| [Area]   | [Status]     | [Status] | [Status] | [Status] | [Must/Nice-to-Have] |

**Status:** ✅ Full | 🟡 Partial | ❌ Missing | 🚧 Beta

For each gap where you're behind:

- What specifically is missing?
- Who cares about this gap?
- Are we losing deals because of it?

## Phase 3: Strategic Gaps (Top 5)

For each gap, in priority order:

```
### Gap [N]: [Feature Name]

**Market Pressure:** [High/Medium/Low]
- Evidence: [Customer requests, lost deals, research]
- Competitors who have it: [List]

**Customer Impact:**
- Affected segment: [Who needs this]
- Deal size: [Average ACV]
- Volume: [Opportunities per quarter]

**Build vs Buy vs Partner:**
- Build effort: [Story points]
- Buy option: [Available integrations]
- Partner option: [Potential partnerships]
- Recommendation: [Which and why]

**Differentiation Angle:**
- Their approach: [How competitors do it]
- Our opportunity: [How we could do it better]
```

## Phase 4: Win/Loss Patterns

**Why We Win:**
| Factor | Frequency | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| [Capability] | [% of wins] | [Quote/evidence] |

**Why We Lose:**
| Factor | Frequency | Lost Value | To Whom |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| [Gap/disadvantage] | [% of losses] | [ACV] | [Competitor] |

## Phase 5: Roadmap Recommendations

**Immediate (Next Quarter):**

```
### [Feature/Improvement]
- Rationale: [Why this moves the needle]
- Expected impact: [Deals saved, churn reduced]
- Investment: [Story points]
- Risk of not doing: [What we lose]
```

**Medium-Term (2-3 Quarters):**
[Same format, 2-3 items]

## Phase 6: Priority Scoring

Calculate for top 5 gaps:

```
Priority = (Market Pressure × Deal Impact × Strategic Fit) / Build Effort
```

| Gap | Market | Deal | Fit | Effort | Score | Rank |
| --- | ------ | ---- | --- | ------ | ----- | ---- |

**Top 3 to pursue:**

1. [Feature] - Score: [X] - Rationale: [Why]
2. [Feature] - Score: [X] - Rationale: [Why]
3. [Feature] - Score: [X] - Rationale: [Why]

## Rules

- Ground recommendations in evidence (quotes, data, patterns)
- Distinguish table stakes from differentiators
- Focus on gaps that affect revenue, not vanity features
- Use ask tool
