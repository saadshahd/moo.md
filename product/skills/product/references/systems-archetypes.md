# Systems Archetypes

Recurring patterns of system behavior that produce predictable outcomes. Recognize the pattern, predict the dysfunction.

---

## When to Use

- Product growth has stalled unexpectedly
- Organization keeps hitting the same problems
- Quick fixes that make things worse long-term
- Competitors catching up despite your lead
- Resource conflicts between teams

## The Core Archetypes

### 1. Limits to Growth

**Pattern**: Initial success creates reinforcing growth, which eventually hits a constraint that slows or reverses it.

```
[Growth Action] → [Performance] → [More Growth Action]
                        ↓
              [Limiting Condition] → [Slowing Action]
```

**Example**: Startup grows fast → hires rapidly → culture dilutes → productivity drops → growth stalls

**Leverage**: Identify the limiting factor BEFORE hitting it. Invest in removing constraints proactively.

---

### 2. Shifting the Burden

**Pattern**: A problem symptom is addressed with a quick fix, which makes the fundamental solution less likely to be pursued.

```
[Symptom] → [Quick Fix] → [Symptom temporarily relieved]
     ↓
[Fundamental Solution ignored] → [Underlying problem worsens]
```

**Example**:
- Symptom: Users churning
- Quick fix: Discounts to retain
- Fundamental: Product doesn't solve core need
- Result: Discount dependency, no product improvement

**Leverage**: Ask "Why is the quick fix needed?" Fix the fundamental cause.

---

### 3. Escalation

**Pattern**: Two parties compete, each responding to the other's actions, escalating the conflict.

```
[A's Action] → threatens B → [B's Response] → threatens A → [A Escalates]
```

**Example**:
- Feature war with competitor
- Each copies the other's features
- Neither differentiates
- Both commoditize

**Leverage**: Break the cycle. Differentiate instead of matching.

---

### 4. Success to the Successful

**Pattern**: Winners receive resources that make them more likely to win again, while losers are starved.

```
[A succeeds] → [A gets more resources] → [A succeeds more]
[B struggles] → [B gets fewer resources] → [B struggles more]
```

**Example**: Successful product gets all eng resources → other products wither → company becomes single-product dependent

**Leverage**: Explicit resource allocation for new initiatives. Protect experiments from success-based resource grabs.

---

### 5. Tragedy of the Commons

**Pattern**: Multiple parties share a resource, each optimizing individually, collectively depleting it.

```
[Individual Benefit] → [Shared Resource Used] → [Resource Depleted] → [Everyone Loses]
```

**Example**:
- Every team adds monitoring → shared monitoring system overloaded → everyone's visibility degraded

**Leverage**: Make individual costs visible. Create governance for shared resources.

---

### 6. Fixes That Fail

**Pattern**: A fix works short-term but creates unintended consequences that make the original problem worse.

```
[Problem] → [Fix] → [Problem reduced temporarily]
                  ↓
     [Unintended Consequence] → [Problem worsens]
```

**Example**:
- Problem: Slow feature delivery
- Fix: Skip testing to ship faster
- Consequence: Bugs in production
- Result: Even slower delivery (firefighting)

**Leverage**: Consider second-order effects before applying fix.

## Pattern Recognition Checklist

| Signal | Likely Archetype |
|--------|------------------|
| Growth plateau despite effort | Limits to Growth |
| Same problem keeps returning | Shifting the Burden |
| Competitive tit-for-tat | Escalation |
| Rich get richer internally | Success to the Successful |
| Shared resources degrading | Tragedy of the Commons |
| Fixes that backfire | Fixes That Fail |

## Combination

Pairs with:
- [Second-Order Thinking](../../hope/skills/soul/references/tools/second-order.md): Predict archetype consequences
- [Feedback Loops](../../hope/skills/soul/references/tools/feedback-loops.md): Archetypes are specific loop patterns
- [Pre-Mortem](../../hope/skills/soul/references/tools/pre-mortem.md): Use archetypes to generate failure modes
