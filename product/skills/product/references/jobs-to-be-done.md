# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

People don't buy products—they hire them to do a job. Understand the job, not the customer demographics.

---

## When to Use

- Product discovery and definition
- Understanding why users churn (or stay)
- Competitive analysis (who else does this job?)
- Feature prioritization
- Positioning and messaging

## The Framework

### Core Insight

> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."
> — Theodore Levitt

Go deeper:
- They don't want a hole
- They want to hang a picture
- They want their home to feel personal
- They want to feel settled

**The job is the progress someone wants to make.**

### The Job Statement

```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].
```

**Example (Slack):**
"When I'm working remotely, I want to quickly reach teammates, so I can unblock my work without scheduling meetings."

## The Milkshake Example

McDonald's wanted to sell more milkshakes. Traditional approach: survey customers about ideal milkshake attributes.

**JTBD approach**: Watch when people buy milkshakes.

**Discovery**: 40% bought before 8am for a long commute.

**Job**: "I need something to make my boring commute more interesting, keep me full until lunch, and is easy to consume while driving."

**Competitors**: Not other milkshakes—bananas, bagels, donuts, podcasts.

**Solution**: Thicker milkshakes (last longer), add texture (more interesting).

## Forces Diagram

Four forces influence whether someone "hires" a new solution:

```
                    PROGRESS
                        ↑
    [Push of Current] [Pull of New]
           ↓               ↓
        ←——————————————————→
           ↑               ↑
    [Anxiety of New] [Habit of Current]
                        ↓
                    NO CHANGE
```

| Force | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Push** | Pain with current solution |
| **Pull** | Attraction to new solution |
| **Anxiety** | Fear of switching, learning curve |
| **Habit** | Inertia, "good enough" feeling |

**Switch happens when**: Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

## Job Dimensions

Every job has three dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Example (Uber) |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Functional** | What task? | Get from A to B |
| **Emotional** | How should I feel? | Safe, not stressed about parking |
| **Social** | How do others see me? | Not like I can't afford a car |

Products that address all three win.

## Discovering Jobs

1. **Observe struggles**: Where do people fight with current solutions?
2. **Interview around progress**: "Talk me through the last time you..."
3. **Find firing moments**: When do people switch away from solutions?
4. **Look for workarounds**: DIY solutions reveal unmet jobs

### Timeline Interview

Map the journey from "first thought" to "using new solution":

```
First Thought → Passive Looking → Active Looking → Deciding → Buying → Using
```

Each stage reveals push/pull/anxiety/habit forces.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Persona focus**: Demographics don't predict jobs
- **Feature obsession**: Features are how, not why
- **Competitor matching**: Competitors may not serve the real job
- **Solution-first thinking**: Start with job, not product idea
