# Metrics & Goals

Turn aspirations into actionable goal systems.

## Input Required

Ask for:

- Quarter (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 + Year)
- Draft goals or aspirations (messy is fine)
- Available time per week for goal work
- Current situation context
- What made past goals fail?

## Phase 1: Goal Analysis

Review draft goals and identify:

- Outcome vs process goals
- External dependencies
- Resource requirements
- Realistic scope

## Phase 2: SMART Transformation

For each goal (max 5):

```
### Goal: [Original aspiration]

**SMART Version:** [Rewritten]

- **Specific:** What exactly will change?
- **Measurable:** Metric with target number
- **Achievable:** Why realistic in timeframe
- **Relevant:** Why it matters now
- **Time-bound:** Deadline with milestones

**Weekly Lead Indicator:** [What to track each week]
**First Action:** [Doable in next 48 hours]
```

## Phase 3: Tracking System

Recommend one method per goal:

**Chain Method** (daily habits)

- Visual calendar, mark X each day
- Don't break the chain

**Progress Bar** (quantitative goals)

- Current: **/Target: **
- Weekly increment needed

**Scorecard** (multi-metric goals)

- Points per activity
- Target weekly score

| Goal | Method | Why |
| ---- | ------ | --- |

## Phase 4: Friday Review Ritual

**15-Minute Check-in Template:**

1. **Celebrate** (2 min)

   - What went well?
   - Which lead indicators hit?

2. **Measure** (5 min)

   - Update trackers
   - Calculate weekly progress %
   - Note obstacles

3. **Adjust** (5 min)

   - What needs to change?
   - Next week's priority
   - Calendar block for goal work

4. **Commit** (3 min)
   - One key action for Monday
