# Game-Changing Features

Process-pattern for identifying breakthrough product features that transform user experience.

## 6-Criteria Evaluation Matrix

Score each feature idea (1-5 scale):

| Criterion | Question | Weight |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Impact** | How much does this improve user outcomes? | 20% |
| **Reach** | What % of users does this affect? | 15% |
| **Frequency** | How often will users encounter this? | 15% |
| **Differentiation** | Does this set us apart from competitors? | 20% |
| **Defensibility** | Is this hard to copy? | 15% |
| **Feasibility** | Can we actually build this? | 15% |

Total weighted score determines priority.

## 9-Category Forced Exploration

Force yourself to generate ideas in EACH category:

| Category | Description | Example Prompt |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Speed** | Make something 10x faster | "What if this took <1 second?" |
| **Automation** | Remove manual steps entirely | "What if users never had to do X?" |
| **Intelligence** | Add prediction/recommendation | "What if we knew what they wanted?" |
| **Integration** | Connect to user's other tools | "What if this talked to their stack?" |
| **Collaboration** | Enable multi-user workflows | "What if teams could work together on this?" |
| **Personalization** | Adapt to individual users | "What if this learned their preferences?" |
| **Visibility** | Surface hidden insights | "What if users could see X?" |
| **Confidence** | Reduce uncertainty | "What if they were sure before acting?" |
| **Delight** | Create memorable moments | "What would make them tell friends?" |

Don't skip categories. The best ideas often come from forced constraints.

## Three Scales of Innovation

### Massive (Transformative)
- Changes how users think about the problem
- Creates new market category
- 10x improvement on core metric
- Example: "What if we eliminated the entire workflow?"

### Medium (Force Multipliers)
- Significantly amplifies existing capabilities
- Clear competitive advantage
- 2-5x improvement on core metric
- Example: "What if we automated the hardest part?"

### Small (High-Impact Gems)
- Delights users in unexpected ways
- Easy to implement, high memorability
- Example: "What if we added one perfect detail?"

Pursue all three scales. Small wins fund time for massive bets.

## Ideation Workshop Structure

**Phase 1: Diverge (30%)**
- Generate 3+ ideas per category (27+ total)
- No judgment, quantity over quality
- Build on each other's ideas

**Phase 2: Cluster (20%)**
- Group similar ideas
- Identify themes
- Note unexpected combinations

**Phase 3: Score (30%)**
- Apply 6-criteria matrix
- Calculate weighted scores
- Identify top 5-10 candidates

**Phase 4: Pressure Test (20%)**
- "Why would this fail?"
- "Who would hate this?"
- "What's the smallest version we could test?"

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Only exploring familiar categories | Missing breakthrough angles |
| Skipping feasibility | Wasted time on impossible ideas |
| All massive scale | No quick wins to build momentum |
| No pressure testing | False confidence in ideas |
| Scoring without criteria | Gut feel masquerading as analysis |

## Quick Reference

**Before ideation**: Pick the product area, gather user pain points, review competitor landscape.

**During ideation**: One category at a time, no filtering, capture everything.

**After ideation**: Score ruthlessly, pick 1-3 to prototype, define smallest test for each.

**Success metric**: Did you generate ideas you wouldn't have found through normal brainstorming?
