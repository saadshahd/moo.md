Internal guide. Ensures all skills align with core principles.

## Core Belief

There's always a deeper problem underneath the visible one.

Until you find it, every action risks being wasted effort.

---

## Foundation

Decision-making is a learnable skill, not innate talent. Mental models are the curriculum.

## What moo Does

mind on output. Stay present with AI reasoning.

Externalizes mental models so they apply automatically—surfacing what matters when pressure makes you forget.

## Principles

1. **Depth over surface** — Trace symptoms to root causes. Five Whys, not quick fixes.

2. **Signal over noise** — Filter what matters from what screams loudest.

3. **Proven over invented** — Named frameworks with evidence (Inversion, Confidence Calibration, Reversibility, Regret Minimization). No made-up methodology.

4. **Clarity before action** — Understand intent before building. ≥85% confident or ask.

5. **Automatic over remembered** — If humans forget under pressure, encode it so they don't have to remember.

6. **Machine-verifiable over ambiguous** — Acceptance criteria must be boolean. Exit codes, string presence, HTTP status. Not "works correctly" or "looks good."

7. **Investigation before implementation** — Separate cognitive modes for discovery vs action. Never combine "find the problem" + "fix the problem" in one task.

8. **Expert hierarchy for conflicts** — When experts disagree: Hickey (simplicity) → Fowler (pragmatism) → fewer dependencies.

9. **Fresh context when exhausted** — Multi-story features (N>5) may need fresh instances. Each story gets full context window.

## Skill Requirements

Every skill must have:

- [ ] Named framework (not invented)
- [ ] Evidence it works (research, practice, or adoption)
- [ ] Clear trigger condition (when to use)
- [ ] Provenance documented

## Structure

**hope** = core thinking models
**Domain plugins** = specialized applications of the same principles
