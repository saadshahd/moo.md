Every skill is a proven mental model or thinking framework.

## Why

Under pressure, humans forget to think clearly. We fall back on instinct, skip steps, and make predictable errors.

Mental models are compression. They encode decades of hard-won insight into repeatable patterns.

moo.md externalizes these models so Claude applies them when you forget.

## What Makes a Skill

Each skill must be grounded in:

- A named framework (inversion, confidence calibration, Five Whys, etc.)
- Evidence it works (research, practice, or widespread adoption)
- Clear trigger conditions (when to use it)

No invented methodology. No "best practices" without provenance.

## Structure

**hope** = core thinking models. Domain plugins = specialized applications.
