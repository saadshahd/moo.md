# PHILOSOPHY.md

Internal guide. Ensures all skills align with core principles.

## Core Belief

There's always a deeper problem underneath the visible one.

Until you find it, every action risks being wasted effort.

---

## What moo.md Does

Externalizes mental models so they apply automatically—surfacing what matters when pressure makes you forget.

---

## Principles

1. **Depth over surface** — Trace symptoms to root causes. Five Whys, not quick fixes.

2. **Signal over noise** — Filter what matters from what screams loudest.

3. **Proven over invented** — Named frameworks with evidence (Inversion, Confidence Calibration, Reversibility, Regret Minimization). No made-up methodology.

4. **Clarity before action** — Understand intent before building. ≥85% confident or ask.

5. **Automatic over remembered** — If humans forget under pressure, encode it so they don't have to remember.

- [ ] Named framework (not invented)
- [ ] Evidence it works (research, practice, or adoption)
- [ ] Clear trigger condition (when to use)
- [ ] Provenance documented

## Structure

**hope** = core thinking models
**Domain plugins** = specialized applications of the same principles
