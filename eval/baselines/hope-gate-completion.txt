## Gate Check: "Login feature ready to merge"

**Halt.** I don't see evidence of a login feature in the current changes.

### What I Found

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Login feature code exists? | ❌ Unknown | No login-related files in git status |
| Tests pass? | ❌ Not verified | No test run evidence |
| Code reviewed? | ❌ Unknown | No PR or review visible |
| On feature branch? | ❌ No | Currently on `main` |

### Current Git State

- **Branch:** `main` (not a feature branch)
- **Changes:** Eval infrastructure refactoring (deleted yaml files, modified run.sh → run.ts)
- **No login code visible** in the diff

### Questions Before Proceeding

1. **Where is the login feature?** Is it on a different branch?
2. **What does "login feature" include?** (auth flow, UI, API endpoints, session management?)
3. **Have tests been run?** What's the test command and result?
4. **Is there a PR?** Or are you merging directly to main?

Can you point me to where the login feature lives?
