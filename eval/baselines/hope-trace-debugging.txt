I need more information to diagnose this properly. Let me ask:

1. **Which endpoint(s)** are returning 500 errors?
2. **What pattern** does "keeps coming back" follow - after deploys, after some time, under load, or randomly?
3. **What fix** was previously applied that didn't stick?
4. **Do you have error logs** or stack traces from the failures?

The fact that the bug "keeps coming back after we fix it" is a strong signal that previous fixes addressed **symptoms rather than root cause**. Common patterns:

| Recurrence Pattern | Likely Root Cause |
|---|---|
| After deploy | Fix not committed, wrong branch, or deploy pipeline issue |
| After time | Resource leak, cache expiration, token/cert expiry |
| Under load | Race condition, connection pool exhaustion, timeout |
| Intermittent | Flaky dependency, network issues, state corruption |

---

**Confidence: 30-40%** - Cannot diagnose without:
- Error messages/stack traces
- Which endpoint(s) affected
- Recurrence pattern
- What was tried before

What information can you share?
