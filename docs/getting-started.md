# 5-Minute Start

[Install first](../README.md#install), then run your first command.

## Your First Command

```
/hope:plan "build a CLI tool that converts markdown to PDF"
```

What happens:

1. **Intent clarified** — Questions surface before building starts
2. **Failure modes listed** — What could go wrong, before it does
3. **Library search** — Prior art before custom code
4. **Confidence stated** — Percentage, not "probably"

The system does what you forget under pressure.

## What Just Happened

The soul skill activated. Every response runs through a silent audit:

```
□ Failure modes identified?
□ Library searched?
□ Past learnings recalled?
□ Confidence stated with evidence?
□ Intent ≥85% clear?
```

You don't see this checklist. You see better answers.

## Quick Start Keywords

See [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) for the three keywords that trigger key workflows.

Try one now:

```
delve into how authentication works in this repo
```

## The Payoff

Learnings persist.

When sessions end, the system captures failures and discoveries to `~/.claude/learnings/`. Next session, it surfaces what you learned.

Your thinking compounds.
