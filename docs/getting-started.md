# Getting Started

You have ten AI tools. No system. Every session starts from zero.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add saadshahd/moo.md
/plugin install hope@moo.md
```

That's it. The soul skill activates on every session.

## Your First Command

```
/hope:plan "build a CLI tool that converts markdown to PDF"
```

What happens:

1. **Intent clarified** — Questions surface before building starts
2. **Failure modes listed** — What could go wrong, before it does
3. **Library search** — Prior art before custom code
4. **Confidence stated** — Percentage, not "probably"

The system does what you forget.

## What Just Happened

The soul skill activated. It runs a silent audit:

```
□ Inversion applied? (failure modes identified)
□ Library searched? (production solution exists?)
□ Learnings recalled? (past failures/discoveries?)
□ Confidence stated? (X-Y% with evidence)
□ Intent clarified? (≥85% confident I understand)
```

Every response passes through these gates.

## The Payoff

Learnings persist.

When sessions end, the system captures failures and discoveries to `~/.claude/learnings/`. Next time, it surfaces what you learned.

Your thinking compounds.

## Next Steps

- Read [hope.md](hope.md) for skills and commands
- Add [product](product.md) for PRD, competitive analysis, research workflows
- Add [wordsmith](wordsmith.md) for editing, voice extraction, narrative structure

Install hope. Run `/hope:plan`. Let the system remember what you forget.
