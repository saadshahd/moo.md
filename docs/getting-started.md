# 5-Minute Start

Install hope. Run one command. See value.

## Install

Requires SSH key with repo access.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:saadshahd/moo.md.git
/plugin install hope@moo.md
```

## Your First Command

```
/hope:plan "build a CLI tool that converts markdown to PDF"
```

What happens:

1. **Intent clarified** — Questions surface before building starts
2. **Failure modes listed** — What could go wrong, before it does
3. **Library search** — Prior art before custom code
4. **Confidence stated** — Percentage, not "probably"

The system does what you forget under pressure.

## What Just Happened

The soul skill activated. Every response runs through a silent audit:

```
□ Failure modes identified?
□ Library searched?
□ Past learnings recalled?
□ Confidence stated with evidence?
□ Intent ≥85% clear?
```

You don't see this checklist. You see better answers.

## Three Keywords to Remember

| Say this | Get this |
|----------|----------|
| "delve into how X works" | Deep code investigation |
| "plan building X" | Structured plan with intent clarification |
| "recall what I learned about X" | Surface insights from past sessions |

Try one now:

```
delve into how authentication works in this repo
```

## The Payoff

Learnings persist.

When sessions end, the system captures failures and discoveries to `~/.claude/learnings/`. Next session, it surfaces what you learned.

Your thinking compounds.
