plugin: playground
skill: playground:system
prompt: "I want to map out why our team keeps falling into the same cycle of crunch time followed by burnout. Can you help me see the loops?"
expectedBehaviors:
  - "Identifies system to model (team dynamics, crunch/burnout cycle)"
  - "Clarifies key variables before generating"
  - "Generates single HTML file with canvas-based visualizer"
  - "Includes poke mode for simulation"
  - "Detects reinforcing and balancing loops"
