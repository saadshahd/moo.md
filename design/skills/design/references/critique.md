# Design Critique

Structured approach to giving and receiving design feedback. Transform critique into actionable improvement.

## ⚠️ Required Inputs

Ask for ALL before proceeding. Never assume.

- **Mode** (giving or receiving feedback) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Design artifact** (what's being critiqued) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Context** (goals, constraints, stage) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Critique received** (if receiving mode) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]

If inputs missing → ASK.

## Mode A: Giving Feedback

### Core Principles

1. **Understand before critiquing**: Ask what feedback they want, what's locked vs open
2. **Observations, not judgments**: "I notice X" not "X is wrong"
3. **Offer alternatives, not just problems**: Every critique needs a suggested direction
4. **Tie to outcomes**: Connect feedback to user/business impact

### Output Structure

**Strengths** — What's working and why (with impact)

**Opportunities** — Observations + suggestions + priority (High/Med/Low)

**Questions** — Curiosity about choices, not disguised criticism

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Personal preference as feedback — anchor to goals, not taste
- ❌ Redesigning in feedback — suggest directions, don't take over
- ❌ Stacking feedback — prioritize, don't overwhelm

## Mode B: Receiving Feedback

### Core Principles

1. **Emotional first, then signal**: Acknowledge reaction before analyzing
2. **Categorize by type**: Actionable vs opinion vs misunderstanding
3. **Protect narrative integrity**: Don't let single critique derail vision
4. **Strategic response over reactive compliance**: Respond, don't just react

### Output Structure

**Emotional Check** — What surprised, frustrated, resonated, or you want to dismiss (examine why)

**Signal Sorting**
- Directly actionable: Quote → specific action → effort
- Opinion-based: Their lens → valid point within it → your perspective
- Misunderstanding: What they missed → how to clarify
- Hidden expectations: Unstated standard → is it valid?

**Response Plan**
- Accept: What and why
- Clarify: What they missed, how to explain
- Decline: Acknowledgment + strategic reason

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Suppressing emotion — acknowledge it or it clouds analysis
- ❌ Reactive compliance — responding to everything dilutes vision
- ❌ Defensive dismissal — examine why you want to ignore feedback

## Commitment Readiness

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Emotional reaction acknowledged (receiving mode)
- [ ] Feedback categorized by type
- [ ] Clear plan for what to accept, clarify, decline
- [ ] Response tone appropriate for relationship

**Handoff artifact:** Action plan from feedback

## Related Workflows

- **Before:** any design workflow that produced an artifact
- **After:** implementation revisions
- **Complements:** directions (revisiting choices), system (consistency check)
