# Information Architecture

Define structure before visuals. How content is organized, labeled, and navigated.

## ⚠️ Required Inputs

Ask for ALL before proceeding. Never assume.

- **Content inventory** — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **User mental models** (how users think about this domain) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Key tasks** (what users need to accomplish) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Existing navigation** (current structure, if any) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Constraints** (from constraints workflow) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]

If inputs missing → ASK. If >50% low confidence → FLAG.

## Reasoning Step (Before Structuring)

Before creating structure options, explicitly identify:

1. **Key assumptions** you're making about user mental models
2. **What evidence would change** your approach
3. **Where you need validation** vs where you have confidence

## Core Principles

1. **User mental models > org structure**: Organize by how users think, not internal teams
2. **Generate 2-3 structure options**: Anti-convergence applies here too
3. **Labels are design**: Terminology affects findability and understanding
4. **Navigation serves tasks**: Structure supports what users need to do

## Output Structure

### Content Inventory

Types, relationships, gaps, priorities

### Mental Model Analysis

How users think about this, mismatches to watch, evidence source

### Structure Options (2-3)

Each with: Rationale, hierarchy, navigation model, risks

### Labeling Exploration

Key concepts with 3 label options each, labeling principles

### Navigation Patterns

Primary, secondary, search, wayfinding approach

### Recommendation

Chosen approach with rationale, open questions

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Org-chart navigation — users don't care about internal structure
- ❌ Single structure proposal — limits exploration, risks commitment to first idea
- ❌ Labels without testing — jargon users don't understand

## Commitment Readiness

Before moving to next workflow:

- [ ] 2-3 structure options evaluated
- [ ] Labeling decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Navigation pattern selected with evidence
- [ ] Open questions flagged for validation

**Handoff artifact:** Recommended structure + labeling decisions

## Related Workflows

- **Before:** constraints, journey
- **After:** directions, system
- **Complements:** compare (competitor IA patterns)
