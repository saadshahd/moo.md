# Constraints

Surface limits before exploration begins. Know boundaries so exploration is productive.

## ⚠️ Required Inputs

Ask for ALL before proceeding. Never assume.

- **Project context** — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Technical stack** (platform, frameworks) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Brand guidelines** (existing or starting fresh) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Accessibility requirements** (WCAG level) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]
- **Timeline context** (exploration or commitment phase) — Source: [?] Confidence: [H/M/L]

If inputs missing → ASK. If >50% low confidence → FLAG before proceeding.

## Core Principles

1. **Surface early**: Constraints discovered late waste exploration effort
2. **Distinguish hard vs soft**: Non-negotiables vs preferences
3. **Name unknowns**: Explicit unknowns > hidden assumptions
4. **Include competitive positioning**: What to differentiate from

## Output Structure

### Technical Constraints

Platform, performance budgets, browser/device support, integrations

### Brand Constraints

Visual identity, voice/tone, competitive positioning

### Accessibility Constraints

WCAG target, specific needs (screen reader, motor, cognitive)

### Timeline Constraints

Current phase, decision points, iteration expectations

### Constraints Summary

- **Hard constraints** (non-negotiable)
- **Soft constraints** (preferences, flexible)
- **Open areas** (no constraints, free to explore)
- **Critical unknowns** (must resolve before proceeding)

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Assuming constraints without verification — leads to wasted exploration
- ❌ Treating all constraints as hard — kills creative space unnecessarily
- ❌ Skipping accessibility early — becomes expensive afterthought

## Commitment Readiness

Before moving to next workflow:

- [ ] All hard constraints documented with source
- [ ] Unknowns explicitly listed
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment on constraints

**Handoff artifact:** Constraints brief (1-page summary of hard/soft/open)

## Related Workflows

- **Before:** None (first in sequence)
- **After:** journey, ia, directions
- **Complements:** compare (reveals competitor constraints)
