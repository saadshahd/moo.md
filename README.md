# moo.md

Thoughtful plugins for Claude Code.

## Why This Exists

Under stress, I forget to think clearly.

Pause before building. Name the unknowns. Search for prior art. Surface what could fail. Simple disciplines — gone the moment pressure hits.

So I wrote them down.

When I forget, Claude remembers.

## What It Does

Clarify intent. State confidence. Identify failure modes. Ship with honesty.

Your thinking compounds across sessions.

## Install

Requires SSH key with repo access.

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:saadshahd/moo.md.git
/plugin install hope@moo.md
```

## Quick Start

Three keywords to remember:

| Say this | Get this |
|----------|----------|
| "delve into how X works" | Deep code investigation |
| "plan building X" | Structured plan with intent clarification |
| "recall what I learned about X" | Surface insights from past sessions |

Try one:

```
delve into how authentication works in this repo
```
