# moo.md

Thoughtful plugins for Claude Code.

## Why This Exists

Under stress, I forget to think clearly.

Pause before building. Name the unknowns. Search for prior art. Surface what could fail. Simple disciplines — gone the moment pressure hits.

So I wrote them down.

When I forget, Claude remembers.

## What It Does

Clarify intent. State confidence. Identify failure modes. Ship with honesty.

Entropy over order. Uncertainty over hype.
